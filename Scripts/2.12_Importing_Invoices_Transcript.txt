Welcome back to the Job Book How to Use Series.

In this video, I’ll show you how to import invoices from Job Book into your accounting system.

While Job Book generates invoices for your jobs, best practice is to transfer those invoices into your company’s accounting system. 
This keeps your financial records consistent and ensures everything is tracked properly for bookkeeping and taxes.

Let’s walk through the process.

From the dashboard, click the Navigate button at the top left. 
Click on Invoices.

At the top of the Invoices screen, you’ll see an option to Export Invoices. 
Click it to open the export tool.

Here you can select which invoices to export. 
You can filter by date range, client, or job. 
For example, select all invoices from the past month.

Once you’ve selected the invoices, choose your export format. 
Job Book supports common accounting systems, including:
- QuickBooks  
- Sage  
- Xero  

Pick the format your company uses.

Click Export, and Job Book will generate a file in the correct format for your accounting system. 
Save the file to your computer.

Now open your accounting system. 
Each system has its own import process, but generally you’ll go to File → Import, or a similar menu, and select the file you exported from Job Book.

Once imported, the invoices from Job Book will appear in your accounting system as if they had been created there directly. 
This means your clients, amounts, and line items will all carry over.

Why is this process important?
- It eliminates double entry, saving time and reducing errors.  
- It ensures your accounting system has the most accurate and up-to-date records.  
- It keeps your invoicing process seamless from field work all the way through to accounting.  

That’s how you import invoices from Job Book into your accounting system.
