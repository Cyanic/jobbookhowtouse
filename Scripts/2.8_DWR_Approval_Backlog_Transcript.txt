Welcome back to the Job Book How to Use Series.

If this is your first time watching, 
remember that each episode builds on the last.

In the last video, we explored the Active Job Dashboard 
and learned how to monitor project health in real time. 
That dashboard helps identify which jobs need attention.

In this episode, we’ll dive into the DWR Approval Backlog. 
The DWR Approval Backlog is where a Project Manager 
validates the work records that drive every job metric.

This episode is all about clearing that backlog efficiently 
so approved records reach payroll, reporting, 
and billing without delay.

Before we jump into the screen, let’s review why approvals matter. 
Daily Work Records, or DWRs, capture labour, 
equipment, and materials in a single submission. 
Until they’re approved, they’re provisional. 
Approving them confirms that the information is ready 
for payroll, cost tracking, and invoicing.

I’m logged in as a Project Manager so I can walk you through the 
Daily Work Record approval flow from end to end.

From the main dashboard, look at the Workflow card 
in the middle of the second row, 
then click the DWR Approval Backlog button.
-- Click DWR Approval Backlog --
The DWR Approval Backlog is the DWR batch approval center for every project.

At the top left, you’ll see the Approve Selected DWRs button. 
It will be inactive until you select DWRs to approve. 

At the top right, you’ll see the Expand All, Collapse All, 
and Undo Last Approval Batch buttons. 

Below that is the grouping bar. 
You can drag column headers here 
to group jobs by Job Number, Project Manager, or other fields.

Below that is the DWR Table, 
which shows all DWRs in the system that have not yet been approved.

The first column is a checkbox. 
Clicking the checkbox in the header selects all DWRs for bulk approval. 
Unchecking it will deselect all DWRs.

Next are the Date, Created By, Submitted Date, and DWR Number columns. 
The DWR Number column contains hyperlinks to the individual DWRs.

Then you have the Job Number, Client, Project Manager, and Office columns.

By default, DWRs are sorted by Date and Job Number in ascending order. 
That means the oldest DWRs appear first, 
and within each day, they’re sorted by Job Number.

Multiple columns can be sorted at once. 
If you want to sort by only one column, 
you’ll need to remove sorting from the others 
by clicking the sorted column until the arrow disappears.

If I want to sort by Client, I’ll remove sorting from the Job Number column.
-- Click Job Number twice --

And from the Date column.
-- Click Date twice --

Then I’ll click the Client column heading.
-- Click Client once --

When the arrow points up, it’s ascending. Click again to switch to descending.
-- Click Client once --
Click once more to remove sorting.
-- Click Client once --

You can also filter data by clicking the filter icon 
or typing in the quick filter field in certain columns. 

If I’m Lance and only want to see DWRs for jobs I manage, I’ll simply type 'Lance.'
-- Type 'Lance' --

The dropdown will show a filtered list to choose from. 
Select the employee.
-- Click 'Lance L' --

Now all DWRs are filtered to Project Manager Lance. 
You can clear the filter by clicking the X on the quick filter 
or the Clear Filter icon.

More complex filters can be used by clicking the filter icon on the column heading.
-- Click heading filter --

If you need a closer look at a specific DWR, click the hyperlink. 
-- Click DWR hyperlink --
A new browser tab will open where you can review, edit, or manually approve the record.
-- Click DWR Tab --

Sometimes a DWR might need a small adjustment. 
If it’s just a typo or a minor fix, you can correct it on the spot. 
Keep in mind that direct edits mean you own that change.

If the submission needs more work, 
tell the technician who submitted the DWR to edit it instead. 
Technicians can edit their own DWRs until they’ve been approved. 
Be clear about what needs to change and why.

Approving multiple DWRs one by one can get cumbersome.
-- Click DWR Approval Backlog Tab --

You might have noticed a blue triangle on the left side of the table. 
If you click it, the record expands to show more details.

You can expand all DWRs at once 
by clicking the Expand All button on the top right. 

You can see the line items used, the hours, the unit, the quantity, and the description. 
This lets you quickly review multiple records 
without opening each DWR individually.

After you’ve reviewed the DWRs, check the boxes for the ones you want to approve. 
The Approve Selected DWRs button will become active. 

To approve in bulk, click the Approve Selected DWRs button.
-- Click Approve Selected DWRs --

You’ll see a confirmation pop-up showing the number of DWRs you’re about to approve. 
Click OK.
-- Click OK --

The selected DWRs have now been approved. 
You’ll notice they disappear from the backlog immediately. 
Approving DWRs locks the records, meaning they’re no longer editable by the technician. 
Approved DWRs can now be used in the DWR Invoice Backlog 
if the job is set to Time and Material, 
or directly when creating an invoice. 

If you made a mistake, you can click the Undo Last Approval Batch button.
-- Undo Last Approval Batch button --

You’ll see a confirmation pop-up showing the number of DWRs you’re about to unapprove. 
Click OK.
-- Click OK --

You should see all the DWRs return to your backlog.

If you ever need to unapprove a DWR 
and the Undo Last Approval Batch is inactive, 
you’ll need to locate the approved DWR manually.
To do this, go to Explore in the Daily Work Records card.
-- Click Navigate Home, Click Explore DWRs --
Then go to the All tab. 
-- Click All tab --
Find the DWR you want to unapprove. 
-- Click DWR --
Open the DWR for editing. 
-- Click Edit --
Uncheck the PM Approved checkbox, then click Save.
-- Click Save --
-- Click Navigate, Home --

That’s about all there is for the DWR Approval Backlog. 

If you want to learn more about the DWR Invoice Backlog, 
check out the DWR Invoice Backlog video later in this series.

Approvals should happen daily or at least before payroll cutoff. 
Delays cause payroll issues and slow invoicing. 
Set aside about ten minutes at the end of each day, 
or first thing in the morning, to clear the queue. 
It keeps cash flow smooth and gives leadership confidence 
in the job data they review.

Remember that approved DWRs feed several backlogs in Job Book. 
They populate the DWR Invoice Backlog for Time and Materials jobs, 
they feed cost actuals in the job budget view, 
and they roll into payroll exports. 
A careful review here prevents errors later. 
Accurate data now means faster invoicing and fewer write-offs down the line.

Here’s a quick recap. 
The DWR Approval Backlog is where you validate every Daily Work Record 
before it affects payroll, reporting, and invoicing. 
Check the queue often, use filters to focus, and review each section carefully. 
Those habits keep your data accurate and your projects on track.

In the next video, we’ll stay in the approvals workflow 
and walk through the Expense Approval Backlog, 
so staff expenses are processed quickly and efficiently.

Thanks for watching, and I’ll see you in the next video!
