Welcome back to the Job Book How to Use Series.

In this video, I’ll show you how to use the DWR Approval Backlog in Job Book.

The DWR Approval Backlog is where project managers review and approve Daily Work Records submitted by staff. 
This ensures that time, equipment, and expenses are accurate before they are used for reporting and invoicing.

Let’s take a look.

From the dashboard, locate the DWR Approval Backlog card on the right-hand side. 
Click it to open the backlog.

Here you’ll see a list of all DWRs that are waiting for approval. 
Each row shows the Job, Employee, Date, and a summary of hours and expenses.

To review a DWR, click on it.

Inside the DWR, you’ll see details of the work performed:
- The employee who submitted it.  
- The job it is linked to.  
- The labour hours recorded.  
- Any equipment or materials used.  
- Any expenses submitted with this DWR.  

As a project manager, your job is to confirm that the information is correct. 
If it looks good, click Approve. 
Once approved, the DWR is locked and ready for payroll, reporting, and invoicing.

If something is incorrect, you can click Reject. 
When rejecting, it’s best practice to leave a comment so the employee knows what to fix. 
For example: “Please update hours to match site log.”

You can also Edit a DWR if you have permission, but generally it’s better to send it back for correction.

Approved DWRs disappear from the backlog and move into the system permanently. 
Rejected ones return to the employee for correction and resubmission.

Why is the DWR Approval Backlog important?
- It ensures accuracy of labour and equipment records before they affect invoices.  
- It gives project managers control over what enters the system.  
- It prevents billing errors and keeps reports reliable.  

That’s how you use the DWR Approval Backlog in Job Book.
