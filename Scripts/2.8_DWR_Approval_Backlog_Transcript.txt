Welcome back to the Job Book How to Use Series.

If this is your first time watching, note that each episode builds on the last.

In the last video we explored the Active Job Dashboard and learned how to
monitor project health in real time. That dashboard tells us where attention is
needed. 

In this episode we will dive into the DWR Approval Backlog. 
The DWR Approval Backlog is the first place a Project Manager goes to 
validate the work records that feed every job metric.

This episode is all about clearing that backlog efficiently so approved records
reach payroll, reporting, and billing without delay.

Before we jump into the screen, let's review why approvals matter. Daily Work
Records, or DWRs, capture labour, equipment and materials in a
single submission. Until they are approved they are provisional. Approving them
confirms that the information is ready for payroll, cost tracking, and eventual
invoicing.

I'm logged in as a Project Manager so I can walk you through 
the Daily Work Record approval flow from end to end.

From the main dashboard, look at the Workflow card middle in the second row.
Then click the DWR Approval Backlog button.
-- Click DWR Approval Backlog --
The DWR Approval Backlog is the DWR batch approval center for every project.

At the top left, you’ll see the Approve Selected DWRs button.
It will be inactive until you select DWRs to approve. 

At the top right, you'll see the Expand All, Collapse All, 
and the Undo Last Approval Batch buttons. 

Below that is the grouping bar. 
You can drag column headers here to group jobs by Job #, Project Manager, 
or any other field.

Below that you have the DWR Table.
The DWR Table displays all the DWRs in the system that have NOT been approved.

The columns in the table, from left to right, are:
The checkbox column. Checking the checkbox on the header will 
select select all DWRs for bulk Approval. 
Unchecking the box will deselect all the DWRs.

You then have the Date, Created By, Submitted Date, and DWR # columns.
The DWR # column contains hyperlinks to the individual DWRs.

You then have the Job #, Client, Project Manager and Office columns.

By default the DWRs are sorted by the Date assending and the Job # Assending. 
That means it will show you the oldest DWR first and if there are multiple DWRs
that day, it will then sort by oldest Job #.

Multiple columns can be sorted at once so that means if you want to sort by only one
column you'll need to deactivate the sorting by clicking on the sorted column and 
remove the black arrow. 

If I want to only sort by Client, I'll remove the Job # sorting 
-- Click Job # twice --

And the Date sorting
-- Click Date twice --

Then I'll add sorting to the Client column by clicking the column header.
-- Click Client once --

When the arrow points up it's set to ascending to change it click the heading again
-- Click Client once --

And the arrow will point down setting it to descending order. 
To remove sorting click the header again and the arrow will disappear.
-- Click Client once --

You can also apply filters to the data by clicking the filter icon.
Or typing in the quick filter field in some of the columns. 

If I'm Lance and I only want to see the DWRs for Jobs that I'm the project manager for,
I'll simply Type Lance 
-- Type 'Lance'  --

And the drowpdown will show you a filtered menu to pick from.
Select the Employee 
-- Click 'Lance L'  --

And all DWRs will filter to the Project Manager Lance. 

You can clear the filter by clicking the X on the quickfilter or the clear filter icon.

More complex filters can be used if you click on the filter icon on the column heading. 
-- Click heading filter --

If you need a deeper dive into a specific DWR, 
click the hyperlink and a new tab on your browser will open.
Where you can review, edit, and or manually approve the individual DWR.
-- Click DWR hyperlink --

Sometimes a DWR might need a tweak. If the issue is minor, such
as a typo, you can correct it on the spot.
Keep in mind that direct edits mean you own that change.

When the submission needs more work, 
tell the technician who submitted the DWR to edit it instead of editing it yourself.
DWRs can be edited by the technician who submitted it up until the DWR has been approved.
It is important to clearly explain exactly what needs to change and why.



Approving multiple DWRs this way could be cumbersome. 

You might have noticed the familiar blue triangle on the left side of the table.
If you click the triangle, it expands to show more detailed information on the DWR.

You can expand all DWRs by clicking the Expand All button on the top right. 

You can see the Line Items used, the Hours, the Details, the Unit, the Qty, 
and the description.

Allowing you to quickly review multiple invoices 
without having to dive into individual DWRs

After you've reviewd the DWRs, simply check the checkbox for each DWR.
You'll notice the Approve Selected DWRs button becomes active. 

To do a bulk approval click the Approve Selected DWRs button.
-- Click Approve Selected DWRs --

You'll see a popup getting confirmation of the approval, 
including the number of DWRs you are about to approve.
Click OK
-- Click Ok --

The selected DWRs have now been approved.
You will notice the ticket disappear from the backlog immediately.
Approving DWRs locks the records, 
they will no longer be editable by the technician who submitted the DWR.
Approved DWRs can now be used in the DWR Invoice Backlog 
if the Job was set to Time & Material or directly when creating an Invoice. 

If you made a mistake you can click the Undo Last Approval Batch button. 

You'll see a popup getting confirmation of the un-approval, 
including the number of DWRs you are about to un-approve.
Click OK
-- Click Ok --

You should see all the DWRs back in your backlog. 

That’s about all there is for the DWR Approval Backlog. 

If you want to learn more about the DWR Invoice Backlog 
check out out the DWR Invoice Backlog video later in this series.

Let's talk about timing. Approvals should happen daily or at least before
payroll cutoff. Approving late causes payroll to scramble and delays invoices. 
You should block ten minutes at the end of each day 
or the very start of the next day to clear the queue. 
It will keep cash flow smooth and gives leadership confidence 
in the job data they review.

Remember that approved DWRs feed several backlogs in Job Book. They populate the
DWR Invoice Backlog for Time and Materials jobs, they feed cost actuals in the
job budget view, and they roll into payroll exports. That means a thorough
review here prevents errors from multiplying later. Accurate data now equals
faster invoicing and fewer revenue write-offs later.

We covered a lot, so here is the quick recap. The DWR Approval Backlog is where
you validate every Daily Work Record before it affects payroll, reporting, and
invoicing. Work the queue often, use filters to focus, read every section. 
Those habits keep your data trustworthy and your projects on track.

In the next episode we will stay in the approvals workflow and walk through the
Expense Approval Backlog. You will see how to evaluate expense submissions,
match them to jobs, and keep reimbursements moving on schedule. I will see you
there.

In the next video, we will stay in the approvals workflow 
and walk through the Expense Approval Backlog.
So staff expenses are processed quickly and efficiently. 

Thanks for watching, and I’ll see you in the next video!
