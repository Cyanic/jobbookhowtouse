Welcome back to the Job Book How to Use Series.
If this is your first time watching, remember that each episode builds on the last.

In our previous video we worked through the DWR Approval Backlog.
We confirmed daily work records before they flowed into payroll and invoicing.
That diligence sets the stage for accurate expense approvals.

Today we are going to clear the Expense Approval Backlog.
This is where submitted expenses wait for a Project Manager or Administrator to review.
Think of it as the gatekeeper that protects cash flow, reimbursement accuracy, and client billing.

I am logged in as an Administrator so I can see every expense awaiting review.
You can follow the same process as a Project Manager if that is the role assigned to you.

Before we jump into Job Book, let's talk about why this backlog matters.
Expenses are often pass through costs.
If we approve them blindly we risk billing the wrong client or paying staff for the wrong amount.
A steady approval rhythm keeps reimbursements timely and the general ledger clean.
It also keeps our job budgets trustworthy when leadership checks the numbers.

Now let's walk through the screen together.
From the main dashboard, look at the Workflow card on the right side.
-- Click Workflow card --
In the Workflow list choose Expense Approval Backlog.
-- Click Expense Approval Backlog --

The Expense Approval Backlog opens in a new tab.
At the top left you will see the Approve Selected Expenses button.
It will stay inactive until we have at least one expense checked.
Beside it sits the Reject Selected Expenses button for sending items back to staff.

The main table lists every submitted expense that still needs approval.
By default the grid shows Job, Employee, Expense Item, Date, Amount, and Submitted By.
You can hide unused columns to keep the grid focused.

Start with a quick review pass.
I filter by job when I know I am invoicing one client today.
-- Open Job filter --
-- Select target job --
The backlog now shows only the expenses tied to that job.
This context makes it easier to compare the new costs against the job budget.

To review an individual expense, click the blue row link.
-- Open Expense Details --
Inside the record you will see the employee name, the job reference, and the expense item.
Scroll down to read the description and check for attachments.
If there is a receipt, open it in a new tab so you can confirm the amount.

While you are in the expense record, confirm the accounting details.
Make sure the Expense Item matches your rate sheet or chart of accounts.
If the cost should be split across jobs, tell the employee what to change before you approve it.

If everything looks correct, close the receipt and return to the backlog tab.
Select the checkbox beside the expense.
-- Check expense row --

When you are ready, click Approve Selected Expenses.
-- Click Approve Selected Expenses --
A confirmation window appears showing how many expenses you are about to approve.
Click OK to finalize the action.
-- Click OK --
Approved expenses disappear from the backlog immediately.
They are now locked and ready for billing in the DWR Invoice Backlog and in the Create Invoice screen.

Sometimes you will spot a problem.
Maybe the receipt is missing or the amount includes personal fuel.
In that case use the Reject button.
-- Click Reject Selected Expenses --
Job Book prompts you to enter a rejection comment.
Be clear and specific so the employee can fix the issue quickly.
For example, type "Attach the overnight hotel receipt and resubmit."
-- Enter rejection note --
-- Confirm rejection --
Rejected expenses return to the employee's Expense Entry list with your comment attached.
That feedback loop keeps the audit trail in one place.

You will also run into expenses that look right but belong to a different job.
Instead of editing the job yourself, send it back with instructions.
Technicians and field staff can edit their own expenses until they are approved.
Explain whether they should change the job number, split the cost, or remove personal add ons.

When you face a long queue, use bulk approvals wisely.
Group the backlog by Job Number or Employee.
-- Drag Job column to grouping bar --
Expand the group that you have validated.
-- Expand job group --
Check every item in that group.
-- Check group expenses --
Then approve the batch in one click.
-- Click Approve Selected Expenses --
This saves time while keeping the review process deliberate.

Do not forget to audit the attachments column.
A quick scan for the paperclip icon confirms whether a receipt is present.
If your company requires receipts for anything over twenty five dollars, call that out in your comment when rejecting an item.

Let's talk about integration.
Approved expenses flow directly into the DWR Invoice Backlog for Time and Materials jobs.
They also appear in the job budget actuals so Project Managers can compare committed costs against estimates.
Finance teams rely on this approval to reconcile credit card statements and to build monthly reports.
If we skip the review, downstream teams lose trust in the numbers.
That is why the Expense Approval Backlog is more than a checklist.
It is a control point that protects margins and customer relationships.

Here are a few best practices that seasoned administrators follow.
First, schedule a daily approval window.
Clearing the backlog at the same time each day keeps reimbursements predictable for staff.
Second, stay consistent with comments.
If you reject an expense, always add why and what needs to happen next.
That transparency reduces back and forth emails.
Third, scan for duplicates before you approve.
If two employees submitted the same hotel receipt, reject the duplicate immediately.
These small habits keep approvals fast without sacrificing accuracy.

Before we wrap up, let's recap what we covered.
We opened the Expense Approval Backlog from the Workflow card.
We filtered the list to focus on a single job.
We reviewed an expense record, checked attachments, and confirmed coding.
We approved clean expenses and rejected those that needed more information.
We used grouping and bulk approvals to speed up high volume days.
Most importantly, we saw how this backlog feeds invoicing, reporting, and cash flow.

In the next video we will move deeper into billing and explore the DWR Invoice Backlog.
That is where approved labour and expenses land when it is time to build customer invoices.
Make sure your expense approvals are current so the next workflow runs smoothly.

Thanks for spending time with me today.
Keep clearing that Expense Approval Backlog and your projects will always have accurate cost data.
I will see you in the next episode.
