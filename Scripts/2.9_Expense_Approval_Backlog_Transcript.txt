Welcome back to the Job Book How to Use Series.

In this video, I’ll show you how to use the Expense Approval Backlog in Job Book.

The Expense Approval Backlog is where project managers review and approve expenses submitted by staff. 
This ensures that reimbursements are accurate and that client billing is correct when expenses are passed through.

Let’s take a look.

From the dashboard, locate the Expense Approval Backlog card on the right-hand side. 
Click it to open the backlog.

Here you’ll see a list of all expenses that are waiting for approval. 
Each row shows the Job, Employee, Date, Expense Item, and Amount.

To review an expense, click on it.

Inside the expense record, you’ll see details including:
- The employee who submitted it.  
- The job it is linked to.  
- The expense category, such as accommodations or mileage.  
- The cost entered by the employee.  
- Any notes attached to the expense.  

As a project manager, your role is to confirm the expense is legitimate and accurate. 
If it looks correct, click Approve. 
Once approved, the expense is locked and ready for reporting and invoicing.

If something is incorrect, you can click Reject. 
When rejecting, it’s best practice to leave a comment so the employee knows what to fix. 
For example: “Please attach a receipt.”

Approved expenses disappear from the backlog and are stored permanently in the job record. 
Rejected ones return to the employee for correction and resubmission.

Why is the Expense Approval Backlog important?
- It ensures that reimbursements are valid before they are processed.  
- It keeps invoices accurate when passing expenses to clients.  
- It maintains a clear audit trail of project costs.  

That’s how you use the Expense Approval Backlog in Job Book.
