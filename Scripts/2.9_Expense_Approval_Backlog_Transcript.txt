Welcome back to the Job Book How to Use Series.
If this is your first time watching, 
remember that each episode builds on the last.

In the last video we explored the DWR Approval Backlog.
We bulk approved daily work records before they flowed into payroll and invoicing.

In this episode, we’re going to clear the Expense Approval Backlog.
This is where submitted expenses wait for a 
Project Manager or Administrator to review.
Think of it as the gatekeeper that protects cash flow, 
reimbursement accuracy, and client billing integrity.

Before we jump into Job Book, let's talk about why this backlog matters.
Expenses in Job Book are costs paid by staff on behalf of a job 
that need reimbursement.
If we approve them blindly we risk billing the wrong client 
or paying staff for the wrong amount.
A steady approval rhythm keeps reimbursements timely 
and your general ledger clean.
It also keeps our job budgets trustworthy 
when leadership checks the numbers.

I am logged in as an Administrator so I can see every expense awaiting review.
You can follow the same process as a Project Manager 
if that is the role assigned to you.

Now let’s walk through the screen together 
and see how the approval process works.
From the main dashboard, look at the Workflow card 
in the middle of the second row,
In the Workflow list choose Expense Approval Backlog.
-- Click Expense Approval Backlog --
The Expense Approval Backlog is the expense batch approval center for Job Book.

At the top left you will see the Approve Selected Expenses button.
It will stay inactive until we have at least one expense checked.
At the top right, you’ll see the Undo Last Approval Batch button.

Below that is the grouping bar. 
You can drag column headers here 
to group jobs by Job Number, Employee Name, or other fields.

Below that is the Expense Table.
The Expense table lists every submitted expense that still needs approval.

The first column is a checkbox. 
Clicking the checkbox in the header selects all expenses for bulk approval. 
Unchecking it clears all selections.

Next is the Date column. 
The Date column contains hyperlinks to the individual Expenses.

Then you have the Submitted Date, Job Number, Expense Item, 
Employee Name, Amount, and Description columns.

By default, Expenses are sorted by Date and Employee Name in ascending order. 
That means the oldest Expenses appear first, 
and within each day, they’re sorted by Employee Name.

You can sort by multiple columns at once. 
To focus on one column, remove sorting from the others 
by clicking the sorted column until the arrow disappears.

Just like we did in the DWR Approval Backlog video in this series.

Just like the DWR Approval Backlog, 
you can filter data using the filter icon 
or by typing in the quick filter field in certain columns.

Sometimes an Expense might need a small adjustment. 
If it’s just a typo or a minor fix, you can correct it on the spot. 

If you need to edit or see attachments on an Expense, 
click the hyperlink. 
-- Click Expense hyperlink --
A new browser tab will open 
-- Click Expense Tab --
where you can review, edit, 
or manually approve the expense.

You can also check off the Processed checkbox.
The Processed checkbox can mean different things depending on the situation. 
For reimbursements, it means the staff member has already been paid. 
For billable expenses, it means the expense was included on an invoice.

If you want to learn more about the relationship between 
Processed and Unprocessed Expenses in Invoices
check out the Creating Invoices video later in this series.

If the submission needs more work, 
tell the staff member who submitted the Expense to edit it instead. 
Technicians can edit their own Expenses until they’ve been approved. 
Be clear about what needs to change and why.

Just like the DWR Approval Backlog approving multiple Expenses 
one by one can get cumbersome.
-- Click Expense Approval Backlog Tab --

If you recall from the Creating Expenses video in this series 
every expense represents one item or receipt.

From the Expense table you should have all the information needed 
to approve an expense without opening each Expense individually.

After you’ve reviewed the Expenses, check the boxes for the ones you want to approve. 
The Approve Selected Expenses button will become active. 

To approve in bulk, click the Approve Selected Expenses button.
-- Click Approve Selected Expenses --

You’ll see a confirmation pop-up showing the number of Expenses 
you’re about to approve. 
Click OK.
-- Click OK --

The selected Expenses have now been approved. 
You’ll notice they disappear from the backlog immediately. 
Approving Expenses locks the records, 
meaning they’re no longer editable by technicians. 

Just like the DWR Approval Backlog 
you can undo a batch approval by clicking on the 
Undo Last Approval Batch button.

The process to manually unapprove an Expense is the same as for unapproving DWRs.
You need to locate the approved Expense,
Edit the expense, and ucheck the Approved checkbox. 

That’s about all there is for the Expense Approval Backlog. 

Let's talk about integration.
Expenses flow directly into the Active Job Dashboard, 
allowing Project Managers to compare committed costs against estimates.

When invoicing a Job all expenses related to the job are listed.
Administrators can then include those expenses if needed 
and set the expenses to Processed.

Here are a few best practices that seasoned administrators follow.
First, schedule a daily approval window.
Clearing the backlog at the same time each day 
keeps reimbursements predictable for staff.
Second, scan for duplicates before you approve.
If two employees submitted the same hotel receipt, reject the duplicate immediately.
These small habits keep approvals fast without sacrificing accuracy.

Before we wrap up, let's recap what we covered.
We opened the Expense Approval Backlog from the Workflow card.
We reviewed an expense record, checked attachments, and confirmed job coding.
We approved clean expenses.
We used bulk approvals to speed up high-volume days.
Most importantly, we saw how this backlog feeds invoicing, reporting, and cash flow.

In the next video we will move deeper into billing 
and explore the DWR Invoice Backlog.
That’s where DWRs for Time and Material jobs land, 
making it easy to build customer invoices.

Thanks for watching, and I’ll see you in the next video!
