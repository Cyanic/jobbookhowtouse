Welcome back to the Job Book How to Use Series.
If this is your first time watching,
remember that each episode builds on the last.

In the previous video we generated draft invoices out of the DWR Invoice Backlog and saw how they land in the Project Manager queue for signature.

Today we will finish those drafts and build a fixed price invoice from scratch.

Invoices are where job tracking turns into revenue, so getting the numbers right protects margin, keeps clients confident, and updates the Active Job Dashboard with the true billing status.

I am logged in as an Administrator so I have access to every invoice queue.

From the main dashboard,
look at the Invoices card in the top row.
-- Click Explore Invoices --

We land on the PM Queue.
Any invoice that came out of the DWR Invoice Backlog sits here until a Project Manager signs it.
-- Open Invoice --

Review the header for the invoice number, date, client, job reference, and the summary totals for labour, equipment, expenses, tax, and the grand total.

Each line item below is the labour, equipment, material, or fixed price detail that flowed in from the approved DWRs.
If anything looks off, open the invoice for editing.
-- Click Edit --

The edit screen is split into sections so you can adjust the representative contact, purchase order number, and remit to address.
Use Invoice Type to decide whether the document must pass through the Ticket Queue, and Line Item Type to choose between Detailed and Summarized output.
Detailed lists every line exactly as it was recorded, while Summarized rolls the charges up by category so the client sees a shorter document.

Because this invoice is going directly to the client I will keep the type set to Invoice with Detailed lines.
If the client expects to approve a ticket before receiving the final invoice, change the type to Ticket slash Invoice so Job Book enforces the client approval step.
-- Open Invoice Type dropdown --
-- Select Ticket / Invoice --

Scroll down to the labour section and edit any line item directly without leaving the screen.
-- Update Quantity and Unit Cost --

Below labour you will see equipment and material items, followed by fixed price entries and billable expenses.

If you need to add a charge that never appeared on a DWR, use the Add Line Item button to choose the correct item and enter the quantity and rate.
-- Click Add Line Item --
-- Enter Quantity and Unit Cost --

The subtotal updates as you make changes; use the Totals section to override the bottom-line amount for a fixed price job.
-- Scroll to Totals --
-- Enter Bottom Line Total --

Any note you enter in the Internal Notes field stays inside Job Book.
Client Notes appear on the PDF.
Use them to explain unusual charges or document the date range covered by the invoice.

Scroll further to the Representative Signature section.
This is where the Project Manager or Administrator signs off before the invoice can move forward.
-- Scroll to Representative Signature --
-- Click Add My Signature --

After the signature is captured, save the invoice.
-- Click Save --

The invoice returns to the PM Queue list.
If the invoice type is Ticket slash Invoice it advances to the Ticket Queue; otherwise it moves straight to the Admin Queue for processing.
-- Open Admin Queue --

The Admin Queue is the last stop before the invoice is ready for export.
Administrators check the Processed box after any final audit.
-- Open Invoice --
-- Edit Invoice and Check Processed --
-- Click Save --

Processed invoices drop into the Processed Queue.
From there you can check the Paid box once you receive confirmation from accounting.
-- Open Processed Queue --
-- Edit Invoice and Check Paid --
-- Click Save --

Now that we have finished a DWR-driven invoice,
let's build one manually for a fixed price job.

Return to the dashboard and open the Active Job Dashboard from the Jobs card.
-- Open Active Job Dashboard --

Locate the fixed price job in the grid.
-- Select Job and Click Dollar Icon --

We are on the Create Invoice page for that specific job.
Because this job is billed at a lump sum, the form starts blank.
Choose the Invoice Type and Line Item Type first so the presentation matches the contract.
-- Select Invoice Type --
-- Select Line Item Type --

Next, populate the header.
Set the invoice and due dates so the document matches your billing cycle.
-- Enter Invoice and Due Dates --

Now add the charges.
You can either add individual line items or jump straight to the Totals section and enter the overall price.
I will add two fixed price line items so the client sees how the contract is structured, selecting the appropriate item before entering quantity and unit cost.
-- Click Add Line Item --
-- Enter Quantity and Unit Cost --

If the job includes reimbursable expenses, pull them in using the Add Expense button.
-- Add Expense --

Attach supporting documents such as signed field tickets or photos to reinforce the charges.
-- Click Add Attachment --

Before saving, double-check the Summary section; taxes calculate automatically based on your setup, and you can override them when the client provides exemption documentation.
-- Review or Adjust Tax Section --

Use the Narrative field to restate the milestone or deliverable so the client knows exactly what was completed.

Save the invoice to push it into the workflow.
-- Click Save --

Even a manually created invoice follows the same sequence: PM Queue for signature, Ticket Queue if required, then the Admin Queue for processing.
When you mark it as Processed it becomes available in the Invoice Process Backlog, where you export batches to QuickBooks, Sage, Xero, or any other accounting system you integrate with.

Here are a few best practices before we wrap up.

Schedule a weekly invoice review slot so you catch issues before documents go out.

Use Detailed format for new clients until they trust your reporting, then switch to Summarized to shorten the PDF.

Always add a client-facing note when you adjust quantities or rates, and process exports in small batches to simplify reconciliation in your accounting system.

Let's recap what we covered today.
We reviewed DWR-generated invoices in the PM Queue.
We adjusted line items, captured signatures, and processed the document for accounting export.
We also created a fixed price invoice manually, covered invoice type and line item formatting, and added supporting notes and attachments.

In the next video we will move into the Invoice Process Backlog.
You will see how to package invoices for QuickBooks, Sage, or any other accounting platform your firm uses.
