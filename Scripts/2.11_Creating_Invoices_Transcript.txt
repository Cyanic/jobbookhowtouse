Welcome back to the Job Book How to Use Series.

In this video, I’ll show you how to create invoices in Job Book.

Invoices are how you bill your clients for the work your team has completed. 
They pull together approved DWRs, expenses, and fixed price items, so billing is accurate and easy.

Let’s walk through the process.

From the dashboard, click the Navigate button at the top left. 
Click on Invoices. 
Then click Create.

The first field is Client. 
Select the client you want to invoice. 
For example, “Springfield Engineering Ltd.”

Next, choose the Job. 
Pick the job linked to this client. 
For example, “Boundary Survey – 5th Avenue.”

Job Book will automatically pull in all approved DWRs, expenses, and line items associated with this job. 
You’ll see them listed under the invoice details.

Review the line items carefully:
- Labour items such as hours worked by your staff.  
- Equipment and materials used on the job.  
- Approved expenses linked to this job.  
- Fixed price items for lump-sum services.  

If needed, you can edit quantities or rates directly on the invoice. 
For example, adjusting the number of hours or updating a fixed price amount.

You can also add new line items manually if something wasn’t captured earlier. 
For example, “Third Party Charges.”

Once everything looks correct, add Invoice Notes if needed. 
These are visible to the client and are useful for extra details, such as “Includes field work completed in March.”

At the top of the invoice, you’ll see the Invoice Number and Date. 
Job Book will automatically generate these, but you can edit them if your company has a different numbering system.

When you’re satisfied, click Save. 
The invoice is now created and will appear in the Invoice Process Backlog for review.

Why is this process important?
- Invoices only include approved DWRs and expenses, ensuring accuracy.  
- Administrators and project managers can review invoices before sending.  
- Clients receive clear, professional invoices directly from the system.  

That’s how you create invoices in Job Book.
