Welcome back to the Job Book How to Use Series.
If this is your first time watching, 
remember that each episode builds on the last.

In the previous video we generated draft invoices out of the DWR Invoice
Backlog and saw how they land in the Project Manager queue for sign off.

Today we will finish that time-and-materials draft invoice 
and build a fixed price invoice from scratch.

Invoices are where job tracking turns into revenue, so getting the numbers
right protects margin, keeps clients confident, and updates the Active Job
Dashboard with the true billing status.

I am logged in as an Administrator.

From the main dashboard, look at the Invoices card, 
it's the first card on the second row.

Then click the Explore button.
-- Click Explore --

This is the Invoice Management section.

If you recall from watching the Creating DWRs video 
earlier in this series.
The inteface should look familiar but different. 

At the top youâ€™ll see seven tabs: 
If you recall from the DWR Invoice Backlog video, 
when you first create an invoice, it will start in the PM Queue. 

Here you can see the time-and-material invoice we created 
in the previous DWR Invoice Backlog video.

Once the invoice is signed off, it will either move to the Ticket Queue 
if the Job was set to Ticket slash Invoice, or it will move to the Admin Queue.

The Admin Queue is where the invoices are Processed, 
once Processed the invoices move to the Processed tab.

From there the last step would be setting the invoice to Paid.
That will move it to the Paid tab.

That is the lifecycle of an invoice. 

The last two tabs are My Forms, consisting of all the invoices you created.

And Finally the All tab.

Below the tabs are the Filter Settings and the Searchbar

Then below that you have the Create Button and Export to Excel Button. 

Finally you have the item list of invoices.
From the item list you can see the Client name, Job Number, Project Name, 
the Date the invoice was created, and Invoice number.

Lets take a closer look at the time-and-meterials invoice we created earlier. 
Click on the invoice.
-- Click Invoice --

There are five buttons on the top of the Display screen. 
Edit, Export to PDF, Export to Word, Delete, and Back.

The Edit button will allow you to edit the Invoice.
The Export to PDF button creates a pdf file you can print or email 
to a customer if needed.
The Export to Word button creates a word file you can edit if needed, 
before sending it to the customer.
The Delete button will delete the Invoice 
and the Back button will take you back to the display screen.

You'll notice a blue bar saying:
This invoice is in the PM Queue 
and needs a Representative Signature to proceed.

Let's do exactly that and sign off on the invoice to see what happens. 

Click the Edit button so we can sign off on the invoice.
-- Click Edit --

Here you can review, modify, and sign off on the invoice.

There is the date, Invoice Number and Job. 

If expenses were created on the job you will see an Expenses table.
If you remember from our Creating Expense video 
we created an expense to this job and here it is. 

You can add expenses to the invoice as need by adding line items to the invoice. 
Once you've accounte for the expense you can click the expense checkbox.
When you save the invoice the Expense will be set to processed and will disappear
from the expense list. 

Let's pretent this expense is already accounted for in our labour costs. 
So we'll simply check it off. 

Inside the Invoice Details are six tabs.
The Labour Costs tab displays the labour costs. In this time-and-materials invoice
the labour costs consist of all the DWR data for labour.

You can modify most items here. The Amount is calcualted based on 
the unit cost multiplied by the quanitity.

If you change the Quantity of hours worked on a invoice 
it does not change the hours worked for your staff.

That means you can for example change this from being 8 hours to 10 hours 
and the Party Chief will not get paid an extra 2 hours.

Changing values on the invoice does not effect payroll.

I'll scroll through these Labour Cost Items changing values as needed.

Once labour is reviewed scroll up and click on the next tab.
-- Click Equipment and Materials --

You can make the same modifications to equipment and materials as needed.
If you need to add a charge that never appeared on a DWR, use the Add Line
Item button to choose the correct item and enter the quantity and rate.

After that move to the next tab.
-- Click Fixed Price --

Because this invoice was for a time-and-materials Job 
I'm not going to add any Fixed Price Items. 
I'll show you how to do that later in the video 
when we make our lump sum invoice.

The next tab over is the Unpriced tab.
-- Click Unpriced --

Here you can add unpriced items. Basically it will allow you to 
add a description to the invoice. 
I'll add some text so you can see how it behaves on the invoice.
-- Type: here is some text --

Next we have the Job Details tab.
-- Click Job Details --

This will show the person making the invoice, the original Job information.
Finally you have the Attachments tab.
-- Click Attachments --

You can add attachemnts to this invoice. Attachements are internal and are used
for reference for Administrators

Under the Invoice Details is the Terms and Conditions.
You can add any terms and conditions to the invoice if you like.

Because we will be exporting the invoices to our accounting software 
I will not bother filling this out. 

Next you have the Totals.
Each of the Labour, Equipment and Materials, and Fixed price tabs 
have a subtotal. 
The subtotal updates as you make changes.

If the Job was set to fixed price the Total section can be modified.
Otherwise the Total section is the total price of the invoice. 

After the Total you have the Representative Signature. 
This is where the Project Manager or Administrator 
sign off on the invoice before it can move forward.
Signing off on the invoice means that the invoice has been reviewed 
and that all charges have been accounted for.

Click Add My Signature.
-- Click Add My Signature --

Assuming you've setup your employee and employee signature in Job Book, 
your signature will be added to the invoice 
and your name will be used as the Representative.

Click the Save button to save the Invoice and let's go back to the 
Invoice Management section to see what happens. 
-- Click Save --
-- Click Back --

Notice the invoice is no longer in the PM Queue tab.
If the invoice type is Ticket slash Invoice it advances to the Ticket Queue.
Otherwise it moves straight to the Admin Queue for processing.

If you click on the Admin Queue tab you will see it listed.
-- Click Admin Queue --

The admin Queue is the last stop before the invoice is ready for export.
Let's review this invoice again.
-- Open Invoice --

You'll notice a blue bar changed and now says:
This invoice is in the Admin Queue 
and needs the Proessed checkbox to be checked for the invoice to be Processed.

What you do at this point really depends on the way your company processes invoices.
You might email the customer the PDF invoice,
You might import the invoice to your accounting system 
Or you might do something else. 
Either way once you have processed the invoice 
you can Edit the invoice and check off Processed.
-- Scroll to bottom --

I'll pretend that this invoice was just processed.
-- Edit Invoice and Check Processed --

If your process is to import invoices from Job Book to your accounting system 
you can record the accounting reference number below the Processed checkbox.
This is handy later on if you ever want to 
compare the accounting invoice to the Job Book invoice.
-- Click Save --

Let's see what the Invoice Display screen looks like now. 
-- Click Back --

Notice the invoice is no longer in the Admin Queue tab.
It moved to the Processed tab.
If you click on the Processed tab you will see it listed there.
-- Click Processed tab --

Note if you make a mistake at any point 
you can always simply Edit the Invoice 
and uncheck Processed checkbox 
and the Invoice will move back from the 
Processed tab to the Admin Queue. 

The Processed tab are all the invoices that have been processed.
Let's take a closer look at this invoice again.
-- Open Invoice --

You'll notice a blue bar changed again and now says:
This invoice is in Processed
and needs the Paid checkbox to be checked for the invoice to be Paid.

What happenes to the Invoice once it reaches the Processed tab 
is again up to the way your company manages invoices.

You can keep track of paid invoices in Job Book and your accounting system.
Or you can leave all the invoices in the Processed tab and not track paid invoices in Job Book.

If you decide to keep track of paid invoices in Job Book also here is how it's done.
-- Scroll to bottom --

I'll pretend the customer just paid for this invoice.
-- Edit Invoice and Check Paid --
-- Click Save --

We just set the invoice to Paid, 
let's go Back and take a look at the Invoice Display screen.

Notice the invoice is no longer in the Processed tab.
It moved to the Paid tab.
If you click on the Paid tab you will see it listed there.
-- Click Paid tab --

The Paid tab is the last stage of an Invoice.

Now that we have finished the lifecycle of a time-and-materials invoice,
let's build an invoice manually for a fixed price job.

To do that let's return to the dashboard.
-- Click Navigate Home --

There are multiple ways of creating an invoice in Job Book.
One way would be to simply click the Create New button 
in the Invoices card, and select the job to invoice.

The other easier way would be to use the Active Job Dashboard. 
Let's use the Active Job Dashboard. 
-- Open Active Job Dashboard --

Locate the Fixed Price job in the grid you'd like to invoice.
Let's use this boundry survey for eighteen-hundred dollars.
and click the Dollar icon. 
-- Click Dollar Icon --

We are on the Create Invoice page for that specific job. 
Because this job is billed at a lump sum, the form starts blank. 

If you had chosen a Time & Materials type job 
you would be able to select from a group of DWRs 
filtered by the job to import into the invoice.

Click on the Fixed Price tab in the Innvoice Details.
-- Click Fixed Price --

Let's add the Fixed Price line item.
Click Add
-- Click Add --

And from the Cost Item dropdown select Boundry Survey. 
You can edit the Unit Cost and Quantity and add a Description. 
-- Set Unit Cost: $1800, Quantity: 1, Description: Boundary Survey --

Notice everything here is the same as the previous steps we took when we created a DWR Invoice. 

Scroll to the bottom and save the invoice to push it into the workflow.
-- Click Save --

Even a manually created invoice follows the same sequence: 
PM Queue for signature, Ticket Queue if required, 
then the Admin Queue for processing. 
When the invoice is in the Admin Queue 
it becomes available in the Invoice Process Backlog,
where you export batches to QuickBooks, Sage, Xero, 
or any other accounting system you work with.

If you are interested in learning more about exporting batch invoices 
See our next video the Invoice Process Backlog video.
Where we'll show you how to export invoices to your accounting system.

That's about all there is for creating invoices in Job Book.

Here are a few best practices before we wrap up.

If you are an administrator, check the DWR Invoice Backlog regularly 
to ensure all approved DWRs are converted into draft invoices.

If you are a project manager, check the PM Queue regulary 
to stay on top of invoice approvals.

Schedule a weekly invoice review slot so you catch issues before documents go
out.

Let's recap what we covered today. 
We reviewed DWR-generated invoices.
We adjusted line items, and moved the invoice from the PM Queue to the Admin Queue 
by signing off on the invoice. 
We manually processed the invoice and set an invoice to paid. 
We also talked about manualy creating an invoice 
and we created a fixed price invoice using the Active Job Dashboard.

In the next video we will move into the Invoice Process Backlog. You will see
how to package invoices for QuickBooks, Sage, or any other accounting platform
your firm uses.

Thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next video!
