Welcome back to the Job Book How to Use Series.

If you’re just joining, make sure you’ve watched the earlier episodes 
because each one builds on the last.

In the Creating DWRs and the Creating Expenses videos 
we created time sheets and expenses and assigned them to Jobs. 

All those submissions flow into the Active Job Dashboard.
The Active Job Dashboard is a report that brings job status, labour, 
expenses, and billing all into one view.

Staying on top of it lets you see overall budget burn, and keep invoices moving
so cash flow stays predictable. 

You can see see job status, and dive deep into individual job performance metrics.

I am currently logged in as a Project Manager. 
Administrators and Job Coordinators see the same layout, 
and follow identical steps.

From the main dashboard, look at the Jobs card in the top row.
Then click the Active Job Dashboard button.
-- Click Active Job Dashboard --
The Active Job Dashboard becomes the control center for every live project.

Starting from the top left you can see the Export to Excel button. 
Clicking this button will download an Excel file that 
contains all job data you are currently viewing

Next to that is the Templating section. 
Here you can create templates to customize 
how you view the Active Job Dashboard.

We do a deep dive into Templating in our Job Book Reporting Guide Series

Below that is the grouping bar. 
Here you can drag column headers and group jobs by all the different headers.
For example you can group all the Jobs by the Client Name or Project Manager. 

Again we do a deep dive into this advanced feature in our 
Job Book Reporting Guide Series.

Below that you have the Job Table.
The Job Table displays all active jobs in the system.
You can change how many columns you see 
and apply filters to the data. More about that later in this video. 

Looking at the default view from left to right you will see 
the Job Number, the Client name, the Project Manager, 

the Status column shows exactly where that job sits in your workflow, 
whether that is Job Setup, In Progress, Ready for Billing, or any stage your company uses.

Next the Billing Type, and Due Date.

The next set of columns are the key indicators project managers rely on. 

The Purchase Order amount, 
The DWR amount are the aggregated hours to date multiplied by the billing rates, 
pulled from submitted and approved DWRs. 

The expenses to date, assoicated with the job rolls up reimbursable costs 
submitted through the expense workflow.

The total invoiced , the last invoice date, and the Action column. 

The Action column has four buttons. Each button is specific to the job. 

The Job Charge-Out Rate Report is a report that shows all DWR and invoice activity.

The Job Charge-Out Rate Summary Report is a report that aggregates all the line items
and allows you to compare the budgeted amounts to the DWR amounts to Invoice amounts.

The Job History Report is a report that shows all line items associated with a job 
including any assets used including any notes.

Each report provides valuable insights that can help you make informed decisions 
about job performance, costs, and history related to the job.

For detailed instructions on these reports see our Job Book Reporting Guide Series. 

The final button is the Creat Invoice button. This will take you to the DWR Inovice Backlog
and filter out only DWRs associated with the job. Here you can convert time sheets into invoices.
We cover the DWR Inovice Backlog and Invoice creation later in this How to Use Job Book Series. 

The Job Table is a crucial tool for tracking job performance 
and is essential to ensure accurate budgeting and financial accountability.

Some of the eagle eyed of you, might have noticed a blue triangle on the left side of the table.
If you click the triangle it will expand to reveal all the invoices associatedwith that job.

Looking at the Job Number column you'll see a black arrow. 
This will sort the invoices in ascending or descending order.
If you click the arrow again that column will be unsorted. 

You can sort by any column in the table by clicking on the column.
-- Click Client -- 

You can add or remove columns in the Job Table. 
Simply click the three black dots on any of the columns.
-- Click 3-dots --

You'll see a dropdown to sort by ascending, sort by decending, columns, and filter. 
Hover over the Columns menu item. It will expand and show you a checklist of all the columns.
Columns that are curently visible are checked and unchecked columns are not visible.

Perhaps being a project manager the Billing Type column is not important to you. 
In that case simply click the checkbox next to Billing Type 
and the column will disapear from your view.

Speaking of Project Manager that column shows all the project managers for all the active jobs. 
You are probabably not interested in jobs you are not managing, 
so next let's filter the jobs to show only the jobs you are managing. 
Click the three black dots again over the Project Manager column. 
-- Click 3-dots --

And hover over the filter item. 
You can use "Show items with value that:" "Is equal to" or what I like to do is use is 
"Starts with" or "Contains"
Then write your name
-- Write Lance --
and click Filter
-- Click Filter --
Now you can see only the jobs you are managing in the dashboard, 
making it easier to manage your jobs and streamlining your workflow.

That’s about the basics of the Active Job Dashboard. 

Here is how the Active Job Dashboard ties into the rest of Job Book.

Every DWR and expense you saw in earlier episodes updates these metrics the
moment it is submitted. Project managers use these metrics to manage their jobs.

Administrators use the Active Job Dashboard to quickly find jobs and then either 
use the DWR Invoice Backlog or the invoice module to keep billing on schedule. 

Keeping the dashboard accurate requires a few habits. 
Update job statuses as soon as milestones change. 
Inactive jobs can not be used by technitions when creating DWRs 
so keeping on top of active and inactive jobs is important minimizing mistakes.

Make sure new jobs include budget quantities, even for time and materials work,
because the burn compares actuals to those numbers. 

Encourage technicians to submit DWRs and expenses daily; otherwise the Hours to Date and
Expenses to Date columns lag behind reality. 

When a job shows activity but no approved billing, check whether invoices are 
waiting for documents or sitting in draft.

Best practices keep the dashboard useful day after day. 
Review it first thing every morning to spot hot spots before crews leave the yard. 

Review the Burn column before client calls so you can address potential overruns proactively. 
If a job shows zero entries for several days, call the field lead and confirm that 
crews are submitting DWRs on time.

Administrators and project managers should schedule a standing dashboard review.

Maintain this rhythm and the Active Job Dashboard becomes your single source of
truth for operational performance. You will always know which jobs are healthy,
which need intervention, and which approvals must close before invoices can go
out.

In the next video, we will stay in the project manager role 
and work through the DWR Approval Backlog 
so technician submissions keep moving without delay.

Thanks for watching, and I’ll see you in the next episode!
