Welcome back to the Job Book How to Use Series.

If you’re just joining, make sure you’ve watched the earlier episodes because each one builds on the last.
In the previous video, I showed you how to create Expenses in Job Book.

Now we are switching to the project manager’s workstation and opening the Active Job Dashboard so you can monitor every live project at a glance.

I am logged in as a Project Manager. Administrators see the same layout, and job coordinators have similar access if their permissions include job oversight.

From the main dashboard, look for the Jobs card in the top row. 
-- Click Active Job Dashboard --
That opens the Active Job Dashboard in a new page. Think of it as your control center for day to day job management.

Across the top of the dashboard you will see filter tools and a search bar. These controls help you focus on the jobs that matter right now.

Let’s read one row together. Each row represents a single active job. Starting from the left you will see the Job Name, the client name, the office responsible, and the system generated Job Number. The Status column shows where the job sits in your internal workflow, such as Job Setup, In Progress, or Ready for Billing.

Next come the key performance indicators that project managers rely on: Hours to Date, Expenses to Date, Approved Billings, and Burn Percentage. Hours to Date aggregates labour pulled from submitted DWRs. Expenses to Date rolls up reimbursables the team has submitted. Approved Billings shows what has already moved through the invoice process. Burn Percentage compares actual costs to the budget quantity amounts you entered when you set up the job. It updates every time new labour or expenses are approved, so you always see the latest position.

The dashboard also exposes operational backlogs. Submitted DWRs identifies how many technician records are waiting for your approval. Submitted Expenses tells you how many expense claims are waiting. Invoice Ready or similar columns flag jobs ready for billing. Scanning these totals once or twice a day keeps your approvals from piling up and prevents jobs from stalling.

If you manage a large portfolio, use the filters before you start drilling into individual jobs.
-- Click Filters --
Set Office to the branch you supervise, choose a Client if you are on a dedicated account, and narrow Status to the stages you want to review. The list updates immediately. Save a frequently used combination as a view so you can pull it up with two clicks during weekly meetings.

The text search is helpful when a client calls and you need to locate a job quickly.
-- Click Search --
Start typing the job name, alias, or number. Job Book filters the list in place, so you keep context while you answer questions.

When you are ready to investigate a specific job, open it directly from the dashboard.
-- Click Job Name --
That takes you to the Job Overview screen. The Summary tab shows the same metrics you saw on the dashboard along with the project manager, client contacts, and budget notes. From here you can jump into DWRs, expenses, invoices, or the job’s document links without leaving the workflow. Use the Back button in your browser to return to the dashboard when you are finished.

Here are a few best practices to keep the Active Job Dashboard working for you:
Review the dashboard at the start and end of each day. Morning reviews help you spot urgent approvals or budget variances before crews head to site. End of day reviews confirm everything submitted during the day has moved forward.
Sort the Burn Percentage column any time you are preparing for a client call. Jobs with the highest percentage rise to the top, letting you prepare mitigation steps before a client asks.
If a job shows zero hours or expenses for several days, follow up with the field lead. Missing entries often mean crews are delaying DWR submissions, which pushes billing and reporting behind.
Keep job statuses accurate. Changing a job from Job Setup to In Progress signals to technicians that the site is ready, and flipping to Ready for Billing alerts administrators that invoicing can begin.
Export the dashboard to Excel whenever you need an offline snapshot for leadership meetings. The export respects your filters, which keeps conversations focused.

Administrators often partner with project managers during review sessions. While the manager watches burn percentages and labour trends, the administrator keeps an eye on approvals that impact invoices. Meeting weekly around the Active Job Dashboard reinforces accountability across both roles.

Two quick tips for staying organized:
1. Pin the Active Job Dashboard tab in your browser when you start your day. It reduces navigation time and keeps live metrics within reach.
2. Use the Comments or Notes section inside the job record to capture follow up items. Those notes appear for the entire project team and link back to the job’s dashboard row.

The Active Job Dashboard turns the time entries and expenses your technicians submit into actionable insight. Stay on top of it and you will always know which jobs are healthy, which ones need intervention, and which approvals must be completed before invoices go out.

In the next video, we will stay in the project manager role and step through the DWR Approval Backlog so you can keep technician submissions moving without delay.
