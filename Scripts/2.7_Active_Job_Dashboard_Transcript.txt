Welcome back to the Job Book How to Use Series.

In this video, I’ll give you a beginner’s guide to using the Active Job Dashboard in Job Book.

The Active Job Dashboard is your command center. 
It shows all your ongoing jobs in one place and lets you quickly check progress, costs, and outstanding items.

When you first log in to Job Book, the dashboard is front and center. 
Let’s take a closer look at how it works.

Each row in the Active Job Dashboard represents a job. 
You’ll see the Job Name, Client, Office, and Job Number right at the start.

Next, you’ll see summary fields showing job status:
- Hours recorded so far.
- Expenses linked to the job.
- Percentage of the job budget used, also called burn.
- Any backlog items waiting for approval.

You can filter the dashboard by office, client, or job status. 
This is helpful if you manage many jobs and only want to focus on a specific group.

Clicking on a job opens the Job Overview screen. 
Here you can see all the details of that job: line items, assigned employees, DWRs, expenses, and invoices. 
This is where project managers spend most of their time monitoring jobs.

One of the most useful features is the burn indicator. 
This shows you in real time how much of the job’s budget has been consumed. 
Green means you’re within budget. 
Yellow is approaching the limit. 
Red means the job is over budget.

The Active Job Dashboard also highlights if there are outstanding DWRs or expenses that need approval. 
This keeps projects moving without delays.

Why is the Active Job Dashboard important?
- It gives project managers real-time visibility on job progress.  
- It centralizes labour, expenses, and invoices in one place.  
- It helps catch problems early, before they impact profitability.  

That’s the beginner’s guide to the Active Job Dashboard in Job Book.

In the next video, I’ll show you how to work with the DWR Approval Backlog.
