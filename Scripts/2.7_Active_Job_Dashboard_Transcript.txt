Welcome back to the Job Book How to Use Series.

If you are just joining now, make sure you circle back to the earlier episodes
because everything we set up there feeds directly into what happens next.

In the previous video we created expenses from the technician point of view.
Those submissions are now flowing into the Active Job Dashboard, so let me show
you how project managers and administrators keep every job on track.

Before we click anything, this dashboard matters because it brings labour,
expenses, and billing into one view. Staying on top of it lets you catch
overruns early, clear approvals before they slow crews, and keep invoices moving
so cash flow stays predictable. You can also see budget burn and approval
backlogs before clients or payroll deadlines force the issue.

I am logged in as a Project Manager. Administrators see the same layout, and Job
Coordinators with job oversight permissions follow identical steps.

From the main dashboard, look at the Jobs card in the top row.
-- Click Active Job Dashboard --
The Active Job Dashboard opens in a new tab and becomes my control center for
every live project.

Across the top you will see a search bar, filter options, and a view selector.
Reading from left to right you will see the job name, client, office, and system
generated job number. The Status column shows exactly where that job sits in
your workflow, whether that is Job Setup, In Progress, Ready for Billing, or any
custom stage your company uses.

The next set of columns are the key indicators project managers rely on. Hours
to Date aggregates labour pulled from submitted and approved DWRs. Expenses to
Date rolls up reimbursable costs submitted through the expense workflow.
Approved Billings shows what has already moved through the invoice process. Burn
Percentage compares those actual numbers to the budget quantities you entered
when the job was created.
If you supervise several offices or manage a large portfolio, start by narrowing
the list.
-- Click Filters --
The filter panel lets you focus on the jobs that need attention right now.
-- Set Office filter --
Pick the office or department you are responsible for.
-- Set Client filter --
Choose a client if you are preparing for an account review or a status call.
-- Set Status filter --
Limit the list to stages that require action, like Ready for Billing or Awaiting
Approval. The table updates instantly so you can act right away.

When a client calls asking about a specific job, the search bar is faster than
scrolling.
-- Click Search --
Start typing the job name, alias, or job number. The list filters in place and
you keep your context while you answer questions.

I rely on the backlog columns to keep daily approvals moving. Submitted DWRs
shows how many technician records are waiting for you. Submitted Expenses lists
pending reimbursement claims. Invoice Ready highlights jobs that can be billed
as soon as supporting documents are complete. If any numbers climb, you know
exactly where to focus first before payroll, reimbursements, or billing are
affected.

When you need more detail, drill into the job right from the dashboard.
-- Click Job Name --
The Job Overview opens in a new tab. The Summary tab repeats the same metrics
you saw on the dashboard and adds project team members, client contacts, and
budget notes. From here you can jump to DWRs, expenses, invoices, or the job's
document links without running another search. When you are finished, use the
browser back button to return to the dashboard.

Here is how the Active Job Dashboard ties into the rest of Job Book. Every
technician DWR and expense you saw in earlier episodes updates these metrics the
moment it is submitted. Project managers can use the Submitted DWRs count
alongside the DWR Approval Backlog to clear approvals before payroll deadlines.
Administrators watch the Invoice Ready column and jump straight into the DWR
Invoice Backlog or the invoice module to keep billing on schedule. When you flip
a job from Job Setup to In Progress, technicians know their time entries will
route correctly, and Ready for Billing tells administrators to start invoices.

Keeping the dashboard accurate requires a few habits. Update job statuses as
soon as milestones change so technicians and coordinators know what is active.
Make sure new jobs include budget quantities, even for time and materials work,
because the burn percentage compares actuals to those numbers. Encourage
technicians to submit DWRs and expenses daily; otherwise the Hours to Date and
Expenses to Date columns lag behind reality. When a job shows activity but no
approved billing, check whether invoices are waiting for documents or sitting in
draft.

Best practices keep the dashboard useful day after day. Review it first thing
every morning to spot hot spots before crews leave the yard. Sort the Burn
Percentage column before client calls so you can address potential overruns
proactively. If a job shows zero entries for several days, call the field lead
and confirm that crews are submitting DWRs on time.
Administrators and project managers should schedule a standing dashboard review.
While I monitor burn percentages and labour trends, my administrator partner
confirms that approvals, invoicing, and exports are pacing with what the
dashboard shows. This cross-role alignment prevents surprises when leadership
requests updates or when clients expect immediate status reports.

Two quick workflow tips keep the dashboard handy. Pin the Active Job Dashboard
tab in your browser so the metrics stay one click away, and save filter
combinations for recurring meetings so you can reload the view instantly.

Maintain this rhythm and the Active Job Dashboard becomes your single source of
truth for operational performance. You will always know which jobs are healthy,
which need intervention, and which approvals must close before invoices can go
out.

Next, we will stay in the project manager role and work through the DWR Approval
Backlog so technician submissions keep moving without delay.
