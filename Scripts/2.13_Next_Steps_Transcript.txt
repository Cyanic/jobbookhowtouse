Welcome back to the Job Book How to Use Series.
If this is your first time watching,
remember that each episode builds on the last.

In the last video we exported invoices through the 
Invoice Process Backlog so your accounting system 
stays synchronized with Job Book billing.

Today I'm closing out the series by reviewing 
what we covered in this How to Use Job Book series. 
Talk about what comes next 
and highlight some advanced features of Job Book.

By now, you’ve learned how to:
Create clients and jobs.  
Record Daily Work Records and expenses.  
Use the Active Job Dashboard to monitor progress.  
Approve DWRs, expenses, and invoices through the backlog system.  
Create and send invoices.  
Import invoices into your accounting system.  

With these skills, 
you can handle the entire lifecycle 
of a job in Job Book, 
from setup to invoicing.

Job Book stays reliable when every role 
keeps information moving.
When technicians, coordinators, 
project managers, and administrators 
stay on schedule, your jobs stay profitable 
and your reporting stays trustworthy.

Daily Work Records and expenses 
keep the operational engine running.
Remind technicians that timely and accurate submissions 
give you real time visibility.

Project managers should live in the 
Active Job Dashboard for real time status.

Watch labour, expenses, and budgets.
Drill into a job whenever actuals drift from the plan.
This view converts Daily Work Records 
and expenses into insight, so keep it bookmarked.

When it is time to bill, 
follow the pipeline we built together.

Approved Daily Work Records flow into the 
DWR Invoice Backlog for time and materials jobs.

Approved expenses appear beside them for billable work.
Fixed fee jobs rely on accurate job setup, 
so keep milestone line items and billing schedules current.
From there, invoice creation, approval, 
and export close the financial loop.

Staying in this sequence prevents missed revenue and keeps reconciliations
painless.

Every stage connects to the next.
Clients and jobs give structure to each transaction.
Daily Work Records and expenses capture day to day execution.
Approvals turn field data into billable output.
Invoices and exports deliver accurate revenue to accounting.

Now that the core skills feel familiar, look at what comes next.
The Job Book Reporting Guide Series teaches you about the various reports in the system.

Beyond reporting, Job Book includes modules that extend your workflows.

The Tasks and Scheduling module give you detailed team to do tracking.

The Leave module keeps vacation and sick time organized without spreadsheets.

The Assets and Safety modules help you manage fleet maintenance, inspections, and
compliance.

Each module follows the same principles you practiced here: clean setup,
disciplined data entry, timely approvals, and consistent monitoring.

In the next training arc we turn to reporting so you can translate operational
data into insight for leadership, clients, and continuous improvement.

You now have the complete toolkit to manage daily work in Job Book with
confidence.
Keep the momentum by reviewing your queues regularly, communicating with your
teams, and exploring the advanced modules that support your goals.

That wraps up the Job Book How to Use Series.

Reporting, which we cover next video series, 
pulls from each touchpoint.
If any stage falls behind, the whole flow feels the impact.



Job Book stays reliable when every role 
keeps information moving.
When technicians, coordinators, 
project managers, and administrators 
stay on schedule, your jobs stay profitable 
and your reporting stays trustworthy.

From the Dashboard 
Administrators can jump into Workflow queues.
Project managers can dive into Active Jobs.
Technicians can reach Daily Work Records 
and expenses without hunting through menus.

We built your client and job lists early on for a reason.
Review the client list every week for 
inactive accounts you can archive 
and contact records that need an update.

Filter the job list by active status 
and due dates to make sure every project has the right 
project manager, billing type, and rate sheet 
before new records arrive.

Daily Work Records and expenses 
keep the operational engine running.
Remind technicians that timely and accurate submissions 
give you real time visibility.

If the backlog starts to build, 
use filters and grouping to triage by 
crew, client, or priority job.
Approving on schedule keeps labour ready for invoicing.

Give expenses the same attention.
Look for missing attachments, 
confirm job numbers, and set processed statuses 
after reimbursements are handled.

Project managers should live in the 
Active Job Dashboard for real time status.

Today I'm closing out the series by reviewing the full lifecycle we covered,
showing you how to keep those workflows active,
and pointing you to the best next steps once you are comfortable with the
day to day rhythm.

Job Book stays reliable only when every role keeps information moving.
When technicians, coordinators, project managers, and administrators stay on
schedule, your jobs stay profitable and your reporting stays trustworthy.

day.

Let me share a few best practices to make the routine second nature.
Build checklists that mirror this series: client intake, job setup, daily
submissions, backlog approvals, invoicing, and exports.
Hold short stand ups so every role can confirm their queues are clear.
Use saved filters and views to keep each person focused on their top priorities.
Document approval thresholds so technicians know when to attach supporting
files and administrators know when to pause a submission.

Now that the core skills feel familiar, look at what comes next.
The Job Book Reporting Guide Series teaches you how to build dashboards for
utilization, backlog aging, profitability, and forecasting.
Beyond reporting, Job Book includes modules that extend your workflows.
Tasks give you detailed team to do tracking.
Leave keeps vacation and sick time organized without spreadsheets.
Assets and Safety help you manage fleet maintenance, inspections, and
compliance.
Each module follows the same principles you practiced here: clean setup,
disciplined data entry, timely approvals, and consistent monitoring.

Take a moment to celebrate what you have accomplished through this series.
You can build clients with complete records.
You can create jobs that reflect how billing truly works.
You can capture labour and expenses in the field and approve them without
losing accuracy.
You can track performance in real time, invoice with confidence, and sync with
accounting.
Those habits keep projects on schedule and budgets on target.

As you continue, schedule refresher sessions with your team.
Replay the episodes that match each role's responsibilities.
Encourage staff to practice in a training environment while the steps are
fresh.
Repetition turns every workflow into a fast, reliable routine.

In the next training arc we turn to reporting so you can translate operational
data into insight for leadership, clients, and continuous improvement.

You now have the complete toolkit to manage daily work in Job Book with
confidence.
Keep the momentum by reviewing your queues regularly, communicating with your
teams, and exploring the advanced modules that support your goals.
