Welcome back to the Job Book How to Use Series.
If this is your first time watching,
remember that each episode builds on the last.

In the last video we exported invoices through the Invoice Process Backlog so your accounting system stays synchronized with Job Book billing.

Today I’m closing out the series by reviewing the full lifecycle we have covered, showing you how to keep those workflows active, and pointing you to the best next steps once you are comfortable with the day to day rhythm.

This episode matters because Job Book stays reliable only when every role keeps information flowing. When technicians, coordinators, project managers, and administrators all follow the routines we practiced, your jobs stay profitable and your reporting stays trustworthy.

Let me show you how to keep that momentum going. Start by anchoring your teams with the same launch pad you saw throughout the series.
-- Open Dashboard --
The Dashboard cards tell each role what deserves attention first thing in the morning. Administrators can jump straight into Workflow queues, project managers can dive into Active Jobs, and technicians can reach their DWRs and expenses without searching the menu.

We built your client and job lists early on for a reason. Keep those lists accurate so downstream steps stay smooth.
-- Open Clients --
Scan the client list every week for inactive accounts you can archive and contact records that need updating.
-- Open Jobs --
On the Jobs list, filter by Active status and due dates to make sure every project has a current project manager, the right billing type, and valid rate sheets. A quick review prevents surprises later when a DWR or expense arrives against the wrong job.

Daily Work Records and expenses keep the operational engine running. Remind your technicians that accurate submissions give you real time visibility.
-- Open Workflow Card --
-- Click Daily Work Records Backlog --
If the backlog starts to build, use the filters and grouping tools to triage by crew, client, or job priority. Approving on schedule keeps labour ready for invoicing.
-- Click Expense Approval Backlog --
Do the same for expenses. Look for missing attachments, confirm job numbers, and set processed statuses once reimbursements are handled.

For project managers, the Active Job Dashboard remains the best control room.
-- Click Active Job Dashboard --
Monitor labour, expenses, and budgets, then drill into the job record when actuals drift from the plan. This view converts the raw data from DWRs and expenses into insight, so keep it bookmarked.

When it is time to bill, follow the pipeline we built together. Approved DWRs move to the DWR Invoice Backlog for time and materials jobs, and expenses approved against billable jobs appear alongside them. Fixed fee jobs rely on your job setup, so keep milestone line items and billing schedules current. From there, invoice creation, approval, and export complete the financial cycle.
-- Click DWR Invoice Backlog --
-- Click Create Invoice --
-- Click Invoice Process Backlog --
Staying in this sequence prevents missed revenue and keeps accounting reconciliations painless.

Integration across the platform is what makes Job Book powerful. Clients and jobs give structure to every transaction. DWRs and expenses capture day to day execution. Approvals transform field data into billable output. Invoices and exports deliver accurate revenue to your accounting software. Reporting, which we will explore next, pulls from every one of those touchpoints. If any stage falls behind, the entire flow feels the impact. Keep that big picture in mind while you manage each queue.

Here are a few best practices to make this routine second nature. Build team checklists that mirror the series: new client intake, job setup, daily submissions, backlog approvals, invoicing, and exports. Hold quick stand up meetings where each role confirms their queues are clear. Use saved filters and views so staff can focus on what matters most when they log in. Document your approval thresholds, so technicians know when to attach supporting files and administrators know when to request clarifications rather than pushing a record through.

Now that you have the core skills, let’s talk about where to go next. The Job Book Reporting Guide Series shows you how to turn all this accurate data into insight. You will learn to build dashboards for utilization, backlog aging, profitability, and forecasting. Beyond reporting, the platform includes additional modules that extend your workflows. Tasks give you granular to do tracking across teams. Leave keeps vacation and sick time organized without spreadsheets. Assets and Safety help you manage fleet maintenance, inspections, and compliance. Each of these modules uses the same principles you mastered here: clean setup, disciplined data entry, timely approvals, and consistent monitoring.

Before we wrap up, take a moment to reflect on the achievements from this series. You can create and manage clients with complete records. You can build jobs that reflect billing reality. You can capture labour and expenses in the field, approve them without losing accuracy, track job performance in real time, invoice confidently, and synchronize with your accounting system. Those are the daily habits that keep projects on schedule and budgets on target.

As you continue, consider hosting refresher sessions with your team. Rewatch the episodes that match each role’s responsibilities. Encourage staff to practice while logged into the Job Book demo or training environment. The more often they follow the workflows, the faster the processes become.

In the next training arc we will focus on reporting, so you can turn all this operational data into insights for leadership, clients, and continuous improvement.

You now have the complete toolkit to manage daily work in Job Book with confidence. Keep the momentum going by reviewing your queues regularly, communicating with your teams, and exploring the advanced modules that align with your goals.
