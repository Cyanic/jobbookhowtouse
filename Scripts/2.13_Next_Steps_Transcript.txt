Welcome back to the Job Book How to Use Series.
If this is your first time watching,
remember that each episode builds on the last.

In the last video we exported invoices through the Invoice Process Backlog
so your accounting system stays synchronized with Job Book billing.

Today I'm closing out the series by reviewing the full lifecycle we covered,
showing you how to keep those workflows active,
and pointing you to the best next steps once you are comfortable with the
day to day rhythm.

Job Book stays reliable only when every role keeps information moving.
When technicians, coordinators, project managers, and administrators stay on
schedule, your jobs stay profitable and your reporting stays trustworthy.

I'm logged in as an Administrator so I can see each workflow queue and make
sure you know where to focus first.

Anchor your teams with the dashboard that opened every episode in this series.
-- Open Dashboard --
The Dashboard cards tell each role what deserves attention at the start of the
day.
Administrators can jump into Workflow queues.
Project managers can dive into Active Jobs.
Technicians can reach Daily Work Records and expenses without hunting through
menus.

We built your client and job lists early on for a reason.
-- Open Clients --
Review the client list every week for inactive accounts you can archive and
contact records that need an update.
-- Open Jobs --
Filter the job list by active status and due dates to make sure every project
has the right project manager, billing type, and rate sheet before new records
arrive.

Daily Work Records and expenses keep the operational engine running.
Remind technicians that accurate submissions give you real time visibility.
-- Open Workflow Card --
-- Click Daily Work Records Backlog --
If the backlog starts to build, use filters and grouping to triage by crew,
client, or priority job.
Approving on schedule keeps labour ready for invoicing.
-- Click Expense Approval Backlog --
Give expenses the same attention.
Look for missing attachments, confirm job numbers, and set processed statuses
after reimbursements are handled.

Project managers should live in the Active Job Dashboard for real time status.
-- Click Active Job Dashboard --
Watch labour, expenses, and budgets.
Drill into a job whenever actuals drift from the plan.
This view converts Daily Work Records and expenses into insight, so keep it
bookmarked.

When it is time to bill, follow the pipeline we built together.
Approved Daily Work Records flow into the DWR Invoice Backlog for time and
materials jobs.
Approved expenses appear beside them for billable work.
Fixed fee jobs rely on accurate job setup, so keep milestone line items and
billing schedules current.
From there, invoice creation, approval, and export close the financial loop.
-- Click DWR Invoice Backlog --
-- Click Create Invoice --
-- Click Invoice Process Backlog --
Staying in this sequence prevents missed revenue and keeps reconciliations
painless.

Every stage connects to the next.
Clients and jobs give structure to each transaction.
Daily Work Records and expenses capture day to day execution.
Approvals turn field data into billable output.
Invoices and exports deliver accurate revenue to accounting.
Reporting, which we cover next, pulls from each touchpoint.
If any stage falls behind, the whole flow feels the impact.

Let me share a few best practices to make the routine second nature.
Build checklists that mirror this series: client intake, job setup, daily
submissions, backlog approvals, invoicing, and exports.
Hold short stand ups so every role can confirm their queues are clear.
Use saved filters and views to keep each person focused on their top priorities.
Document approval thresholds so technicians know when to attach supporting
files and administrators know when to pause a submission.

Now that the core skills feel familiar, look at what comes next.
The Job Book Reporting Guide Series teaches you how to build dashboards for
utilization, backlog aging, profitability, and forecasting.
Beyond reporting, Job Book includes modules that extend your workflows.
Tasks give you detailed team to do tracking.
Leave keeps vacation and sick time organized without spreadsheets.
Assets and Safety help you manage fleet maintenance, inspections, and
compliance.
Each module follows the same principles you practiced here: clean setup,
disciplined data entry, timely approvals, and consistent monitoring.

Take a moment to celebrate what you have accomplished through this series.
You can build clients with complete records.
You can create jobs that reflect how billing truly works.
You can capture labour and expenses in the field and approve them without
losing accuracy.
You can track performance in real time, invoice with confidence, and sync with
accounting.
Those habits keep projects on schedule and budgets on target.

As you continue, schedule refresher sessions with your team.
Replay the episodes that match each role's responsibilities.
Encourage staff to practice in a training environment while the steps are
fresh.
Repetition turns every workflow into a fast, reliable routine.

In the next training arc we turn to reporting so you can translate operational
data into insight for leadership, clients, and continuous improvement.

You now have the complete toolkit to manage daily work in Job Book with
confidence.
Keep the momentum by reviewing your queues regularly, communicating with your
teams, and exploring the advanced modules that support your goals.
