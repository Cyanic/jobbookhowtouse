Welcome back to the Job Book How to Use Series.
If this is your first time watching,
remember that each episode builds on the last.

In the last video we exported invoices through the 
Invoice Process Backlog so your accounting system 
stays synchronized with Job Book billing.

Today I'm closing out the series by reviewing 
what we covered in this How to Use Job Book series. 
Talk about what comes next 
and highlight some advanced features of Job Book.

By now, you’ve learned how to:
Create clients and jobs.  
Record Daily Work Records and expenses.  
Use the Active Job Dashboard to monitor progress.  
Approve DWRs, expenses, and invoices through the backlog system.  
Create and send invoices.  
Import invoices into your accounting system.  

With these skills, 
you can handle the entire lifecycle 
of a job in Job Book, 
from setup to invoicing.

Job Book stays reliable when every role 
keeps information moving.
When technicians, coordinators, 
project managers, and administrators 
stay on schedule, your jobs stay profitable 
and your reporting stays trustworthy.

Daily Work Records and expenses 
keep the operational engine running.
Remind technicians that timely and accurate submissions 
give you real time visibility.

Project managers should live in the 
Active Job Dashboard for real time status.

Watch labour, expenses, and budgets.
Drill into a job whenever actuals drift from the plan.
This view converts Daily Work Records 
and expenses into insight, so keep it bookmarked.

When it is time to bill, 
follow the pipeline we built together.

Approved Daily Work Records flow into the 
DWR Invoice Backlog for time and materials jobs.

Approved expenses appear beside them for billable work.
Fixed fee jobs rely on accurate job setup, 
so keep milestone line items and billing schedules current.
From there, invoice creation, approval, 
and export close the financial loop.

Staying in this sequence prevents missed revenue and keeps reconciliations
painless.

Every stage connects to the next.
Clients and jobs give structure to each transaction.
Daily Work Records and expenses capture day to day execution.
Approvals turn field data into billable output.
Invoices and exports deliver accurate revenue to accounting.

Now that the core skills feel familiar, look at what comes next.
The Job Book Reporting Guide Series teaches you about the various reports in the system.

Beyond reporting, Job Book includes modules that extend your workflows.

The Tasks and Scheduling module give you detailed team to do tracking.

The Leave module keeps vacation and sick time organized without spreadsheets.

The Assets and Safety modules help you manage fleet maintenance, inspections, and
compliance.

Each module follows the same principles you practiced here: clean setup,
disciplined data entry, timely approvals, and consistent monitoring.

In the next training arc we turn to reporting so you can translate operational
data into insight for leadership, clients, and continuous improvement.

You now have the complete toolkit to manage daily work in Job Book with
confidence.
Keep the momentum by reviewing your queues regularly, communicating with your
teams, and exploring the advanced modules that support your goals.
