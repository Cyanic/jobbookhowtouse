Welcome back to the Job Book How to Use Series.

In this final video, I’ll show you what comes next and highlight some advanced features in Job Book.

By now, you’ve learned how to:
- Create clients and jobs.  
- Record Daily Work Records and expenses.  
- Use the Active Job Dashboard to monitor progress.  
- Approve DWRs, expenses, and invoices through the backlog system.  
- Create and send invoices.  
- Import invoices into your accounting system.  

With these skills, you can handle the entire lifecycle of a job in Job Book, from setup to invoicing.

Now let’s talk about what’s next.

### Advanced Features
Job Book has many features beyond the basics we covered in this series.

1. **Custom Rate Sheets**  
   - Create rate sheets tailored to specific clients or contracts.  
   - Override default rates to match negotiated pricing.  

2. **Leave Requests Module**

   - Connect leave requests directly to employee profiles.  

3. **Reporting Tools**  
   - Run real-time reports on line items, job burn, and project progress.  
   - Export reports to PDF or CSV for sharing.  
   - We cover these in detail in the Job Book Reporting Guide series.  

4. **Integrations**  
   - Export data into QuickBooks, Sage, or Xero.  
   - Use CSV exports to connect with other systems.  

5. **User Roles & Permissions**
