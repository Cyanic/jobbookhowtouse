Welcome back to the Job Book How to Use Series.

This series is for staff who are working with Job Book daily. 

If you’re joining mid-series, start at the beginning since each video builds on the one before it.

In the last section, I showed you how to create clients in Job Book. 
In this video, I’ll show you how to create jobs in Job Book.

Every project your company works on should be created as a job in Job Book. 
Jobs tie together clients, offices, project managers, and line items.

Let’s walk through creating a job.


In this video, I’ll show you how to create Daily Work Records, or DWRs, in Job Book.

Daily Work Records are how your staff record their time, equipment, and materials used on a job. 
They replace traditional timesheets and make it easy to track job progress in real time.

Let’s create a DWR.

From the dashboard, click the Navigate button at the top left.
Click on Daily Work Records.
Then click Create.

The first field is Job. 
Select the job this record is for. 
For example, “Boundary Survey – 5th Avenue.”

Next is the Date field. 
Enter the date the work was done. 
For example, today’s date.

Now select the Employee. 
Pick the staff member who performed the work. 
For example, Charlie Chief.

Now let’s add line items. 
Click Add under Labour. 
Select the appropriate labour line item, such as Survey Party Chief. 
Enter the number of hours worked, for example 8 hours.

Next, add Equipment and Materials if applicable. 
Click Add under Equipment & Materials. 
Choose the Robotic Total Station and enter 8 hours of usage.

You can also add Expenses at this stage. 
Click Add under Expenses. 
Choose the appropriate expense item, such as Gas, and enter the amount spent, for example $45.

Once all information is entered, click Save.

Your DWR is now recorded in the system. 
It will appear in the DWR Approval Backlog, waiting for review by a project manager.

Why are DWRs important?
- They replace timesheets and capture both labour and equipment usage.  
- They ensure all project costs are tracked in one place.  
- They provide real-time visibility into project burn and progress.  

That’s how you create Daily Work Records in Job Book.

In the next video, I’ll show you how to create Expenses in Job Book.


Unlike timesheets, DWRs not only record your time but also record your equipment and materials usage. 
Another unique feature of DWRs in Job Book is you can have one person record labour time for multiple people.
As an example you can have a Party Cheif record time for himself and the Rod Man.
