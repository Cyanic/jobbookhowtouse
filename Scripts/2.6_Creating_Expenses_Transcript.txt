Welcome back to the Job Book How to Use Series.

If you’re just joining, make sure you’ve watched the earlier episodes because each one builds on the last.
In the previous video, I showed you how to create DWRs.

In this video, I’ll show you how to create expenses in Job Book.
Expenses are defined as any out-of-pocket costs your staff encure and need to be reimbursed for. 
If your company uses company credit cards then most likely you will have few to no personal expenses you need to be reimbursed for.
But in case you do, that is where Expenses in Job Book come in. 
Remember to Submit expenses as promptly as possible. 
Quick turnaround keeps the reimbursement cycle short and gives managers a real-time picture of true job cost.

I’m logged in as a Technician, but Project managers and administrators can follow the same process.

From the dashboard, look for the Expenses card.

Click Create New
-- Click Create New --

The expense entry form opens. Let’s work through it top to bottom.

Date is the first field and defaults to today's date.
Set this to the day the purchase happened. 
Expenses are meant to reflect the transaction date, even if you’re filing them later in the week.
You should create one expense per payment or reciept. 

The Employee field is next.
-- Click Employee dropdown --
The logged-in employee appears by default, but you can file expenses for anyone if needed. 
I’ll leave it as myself for now. 

Below the Employee field is the Job field.
-- Click Job dropdown --
Pick the job that generated the expense. I’ll choose “Boundary Survey - 5th Avenue,” the same project we used in the DWR episode. 
Best practice: match the expense to the appropriate job it applies to. 
That keeps budgets aligned and avoids rework at approval time.

Let’s move to the Expense Item dropdown.
-- Click Expense Item --
The Expense Item dropdown contains the expense types your administrators configured
- Accomidations, Field Allowance, Field Materials Misc, Gas, Misc, and more.

I’ll select “Gas”

Enter the Total Expense Amount. 
-- Type "78.54" --
I’ll key in $78.54, the amount that shows on the receipt.

For the Description, add a quick note that explains the purchase, such as 
“Filled unit 204 after Boundary Survey crew shift.” 
Detailed notes save time when managers or auditors review the record months from now.

After Description there is the Attachments button.
When you click the button.
-- Click Attachments --
You'll be able to take a picture of the reciept with your cellphone. 
Or if you are on a computer you can click the Select file button to upload a file. 

Attach photos or PDFs of every receipt. Job Book stores them with the record so approvers and auditors don’t have to chase you later. 
Snap the receipt with your phone as soon as you get back to the truck and upload it while you have good data coverage.

Many teams also add a photo of the signed hotel folio as a second backup. 
More documentation means faster approvals.

Finally there is the Submitted checkbox.

If you’re still gathering receipts, uncheck submitted and you can Save a draft expense.
Draft expenses remain in your My Expenses list, and they don’t post to approvals until you finalize them. 
I'll uncheck Submitted.

When you click the Save button the form validates required fields before saving. 
If anything is missing, Job Book will highlight the field in red. 
Simply fix the items, then click Save again.
-- Click Save --

This will take you back to the Dashboard.

To view your Expenses click on the Explore button in the Expenses card.
-- Click Explore --

At the top you’ll see two tabs: My Expenses, and All My Expenses.

My Expenses, shows the Expenses you’ve created but not yet submitted for approval.
Here you can see the Expense we just created. 

The All My Expenses tab will show all your Expenses. 
Once a Expense has been approved you will only be able to see it in this tab.
You can not edit Expenses in this tab.

Let's go ahead and submit the Expense we just created.
To do that click on the expense. 

There are four buttons on the top of the Display screen. 
Edit, Export to PDF, Delete, and Back.

The Edit button will allow you to edit the Expense.
The Export to PDF button creates a file you can print or email to someone if needed.
The Delete button will delete the Expense and the Back button will take you back to the display screen.

For now click the Edit button so we can submit the Expense.
-- Click Edit --

Here you can edit whatever information you like. 
When everything is complete and accurate, check the Submitted box and save.
This will add the Expense to the Expense Approval Backlog for your administrator.

Notice the Submitted Date is datestamped when the expense was submitted.

-- Click Save --
Once saved click the Back button 
-- Click Back --

You'll notice on the Explore list your Expense is gone.
That's because you are in the My Expenses tab.
If you click on the My Form Not Approved tab 
-- Click My Forms Not Approved --
You should see your Expense waiting to be approved by a project manager.

That’s about everything you need to know to create Expense in Job Book.

If you are a administrator you might be interested in how to approve all these Expense. 
If so check out our Expense Approval Backlog video.
We’ll step through that approval process from the administrators point of view.

If you are an administrator you might be interested in how to turn all these DWRs into invoices.
If so check out our DWR Invoice Backlog video. 
We’ll step through that inovice creation from the administrator's point of view.

Before we wrap up, here are a few best practices that keep expense processing smooth:
- Submit expenses daily or at least weekly. Fresh details mean fewer questions from approvers and faster reimbursement cycles.
- Match expenses to the same job you used on your DWR. Consistency keeps budgets accurate and prevents billing delays.
- Upload receipts right away. Faded or missing receipts slow down approvals and can jeopardize reimbursement.
- Use meaningful descriptions. Approvers should understand why the purchase supported the job without calling you.
- Review totals before submitting. Small corrections now prevent a manager from rejecting the expense and sending it back.

By following these habits, expenses move through approvals quickly, you get reimbursed on time, and project costs stay accurate for dashboards and invoices.

That’s everything you need to know to create expenses in Job Book.

In the next video, we’ll shift into the project manager role and explore the Active Job Dashboard 
so you can monitor budgets, progress, and upcoming deadlines at a glance.

Thanks for watching, and I’ll see you in the next episode!
