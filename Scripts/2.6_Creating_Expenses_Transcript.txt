Welcome back to the Job Book How to Use Series.

In this video, I’ll show you how to create Expenses in Job Book.

Expenses are how staff record out-of-pocket costs that need to be reimbursed. 
They are tied to jobs so you can track all costs in one place.

Let’s create an expense.

From the dashboard, click the Navigate button at the top left.
Click on Expenses.
Then click Create.

The first field is Job. 
Select the job this expense relates to. 
For example, “Boundary Survey – 5th Avenue.”

Next is the Date field. 
Enter the date the expense was incurred.

Now select the Employee. 
This is the staff member submitting the expense. 
For example, Ron Rodman.

Next, choose the Expense Item. 
These are set up by administrators in the system. 
Let’s pick “Accommodations.”

Enter the Expense Amount. 
For example, $125.

Optionally, you can add Notes, such as “Hotel stay for field work.”

Click Save to record the expense.

Your expense is now created and will appear in the Expense Approval Backlog, waiting for review by a project manager.

Why are expenses important?
- They ensure staff are reimbursed accurately and promptly.  
- They allow all job-related costs to be tracked in one place.  
- Approved expenses can be included on invoices to clients when appropriate.  

That’s how you create Expenses in Job Book.

In the next video, I’ll show you how to use the Active Job Dashboard as a beginner’s guide.
