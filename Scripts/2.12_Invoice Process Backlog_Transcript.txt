Welcome back to the Job Book How to Use Series.
If this is your first time watching,
remember that each episode builds on the last.

In the previous video, we created invoices
and moved them through the full invoice lifecycle.
We finished our time-and-materials example, marked it processed,
and created a fixed-price invoice.

Today we’ll work inside the Invoice Process Backlog.
This backlog lets you batch process invoices
and serves as the final checkpoint
before invoices leave Job Book and land in accounting.

The Invoice Process Backlog protects cash flow.
It prevents invoices from slipping through the cracks,
keeps exports clean for accounting,
and closes the loop on everything prepared
in the DWR and Invoice queues.

I’m logged in as an Administrator.
Only Administrators can process and export invoices here.

From the main dashboard,
find the Workflow card near the middle of the second row.
-- Click Invoice Process Backlog --

The Invoice Process Backlog
is the processing and exporting center for Job Book.

The grid lists every invoice currently in the Admin Queue
that has not yet been set to processed.

If you’ve watched the DWR Approval Backlog
or DWR Invoice Backlog videos earlier in this series,
this view will look familiar —
and it behaves almost the same way.

I’ll focus on what’s different here.
For all other details, refer to those earlier videos.

At the top left, you’ll see three main buttons:
Export Selected Invoices, Download Selected PDFs,
and Process Selected Invoices.
All remain inactive until you’ve checked at least one invoice.

Sorting, filtering, and grouping all behave
the same as in the previous backlog screens.

The Invoice Table contains columns
that are more accounting-focused
than what we saw in the DWR Approval or Invoice Backlogs.
It shows all invoices still in the Admin Queue
and not yet processed.

The familiar blue triangle on the left
expands the invoice to show more detail —
again, information that’s geared toward accounting.

To prepare a batch export,
select the invoices you want to send to accounting.
-- Check Invoice Checkbox --

Once at least one invoice is selected,
the Export Selected Invoices, Download Selected PDFs,
and Process Selected Invoices buttons become active.

Click Export Selected Invoices.
-- Click Export Selected Invoices --

Job Book compiles the selected invoices
and downloads an export file in your browser.
Only the invoices you selected are included.

You can then import that file into your accounting system.
Job Book supports several export formats, including
QuickBooks Desktop, QuickBooks Online,
Sage 50, Sage 300, or a generic CSV option
for other systems.

We have dedicated videos showing
how to import Job Book invoices
into each of these platforms.
You’ll find links to those videos
in the description below.

Besides accounting exports,
you can also bulk download all invoice PDFs.
Simply select the invoices you want
and click Download Selected PDFs.
-- Click Download Selected PDFs --

You’ll receive a ZIP file
containing all selected invoices in PDF format.

After exporting and importing invoices
into your accounting system,
you can bulk mark those invoices as processed.
Click Process Selected Invoices.
-- Click Process Selected Invoices --

A confirmation pop-up appears
showing how many invoices will be processed.
Click OK.
-- Click OK --

The selected invoices are now processed
and disappear from the backlog immediately.
Processing invoices here
is the same as manually checking the Processed box
in the Creating Invoices video,
except this method lets you handle many at once.

If you make a mistake, you have two options.
The quickest is to click Undo Last Process Batch
on the top right of the screen.
-- Click Undo Last Process Batch --

You’ll see a confirmation pop-up
showing how many invoices will be unprocessed.
Click OK.
-- Click OK --

All the invoices you just unprocessed
will return to the backlog.

If the Undo Last Process Batch button is inactive,
you can still locate the processed invoice manually
and uncheck the Processed box.
See the Creating Invoices video earlier in this series
for a step-by-step example.

Now let’s look at how this backlog integrates
with the rest of Job Book.

Every invoice that appears here
started as a DWR entry
or a fixed-price request
from the Active Job Dashboard.
Project Managers approve the work,
and Administrators use this backlog
to export and close the loop.

When you mark an invoice as Processed or Paid,
those statuses feed directly into WIP Reports
and the Active Job Dashboard,
so Project Managers see real-time revenue updates.

Here are a few best practices
to keep the Invoice Process Backlog running smoothly:

Clear the Admin Queue on a routine schedule
so accounting receives predictable batches.
Before exporting, spot-check
that Representative Signatures are present
and that expenses have been marked processed.
If you need to correct an invoice,
uncheck Processed — it will return to the Admin Queue.

Each accounting platform has its own import workflow.
Typically, you’ll open your accounting system,
choose Import,
and select the file that Job Book generated.
Always confirm totals after import
so any discrepancies can be fixed
before the next export cycle.

Once imported, record the accounting reference number
if your system provides one.
You can enter it inside the invoice record in Job Book
under Accounting Reference.
That way, invoices in Job Book
can always be cross-referenced
with invoices in your accounting software.

After import, invoices from Job Book
will appear in your accounting system
as if they were created there directly —
complete with client details, amounts, and line items.

Why is this process important?
It eliminates double entry,
saves time, and reduces errors.
It ensures your accounting system
has the most accurate and up-to-date records,
and keeps your workflow seamless
from field work all the way through to accounting.

In the next video,
we’ll step back and review the entire
Job Book How to Use journey —
then point you to advanced series
covering Reporting, Assets, Safety, and more.

You now know how to monitor the Invoice Process Backlog,
prepare clean exports for accounting,
and close out invoices with confidence.
