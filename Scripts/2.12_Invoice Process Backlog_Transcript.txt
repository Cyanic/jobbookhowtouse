**Previous:** Creating Invoices  
**Next:** Next Steps

Welcome back to the Job Book How to Use Series.
If this is your first time watching,
remember that each episode builds on the last.

In the previous video, we created invoices
and moved them through the Admin Queue.
We finished our time and materials example,
marked it processed,
and set expectations for fixed price work.

Today we will work inside the Invoice Process Backlog.
This backlog is the final checkpoint before invoices
leave Job Book and land in accounting.

The Invoice Process Backlog protects cash flow.
It prevents invoices from slipping through the cracks,
keeps exports clean for accounting,
and closes the loop on everything we prepared
in the DWR and invoice queues.

I am logged in as an Administrator.
Only Administrators can process and export invoices here.

From the dashboard, find the Workflow card
near the middle of the second row.
-- Click Invoice Process Backlog --

The Invoice Process Backlog opens on the Admin tab by default.
This tab lists every invoice that cleared the
Project Manager review and is ready for administrator sign off.

Across the top you will see five tabs:
Admin, Processed, Paid, My Forms, and All.
Admin contains invoices that still need export or processing.
Processed holds invoices that were exported but not paid yet.
Paid is the archive once payments are recorded.
My Forms filters to invoices you created.
All is a combined view when you need to search history.

Below the tabs is the Filter Settings panel.
Use this area to narrow the list before you export.
-- Open Filter Settings --

You can filter by Client, Job Number, Invoice Date,
or export status.
I like to set a date range so I only export the current week.
-- Set Date Range --

You can also search for a job code or client
in the Quick Filter field above the table.
-- Type Job Number --

The table shows each invoice number, client, job,
project manager, processed status, created date,
and whether the invoice was previously exported.

Open an invoice to review the details before export.
-- Open Invoice --

At the top of the invoice you will see buttons for
Edit, Export to PDF, Export to Word, Delete, and Back.
Because this invoice is still in the Admin tab,
there is a blue banner reminding you to check the
Processed box once you are done.

Scroll down to confirm the totals, expenses,
and signature that came forward from earlier steps.
If you notice anything missing, click Edit
and correct the invoice before you export it.

Once the review is complete, return to the backlog list.
-- Click Back --

To prepare a batch export, select the invoices
you want to send to accounting.
-- Check Invoice Checkbox --

When you select at least one invoice, the
Export Selected Invoices button lights up
at the top right of the screen.
-- Click Export Selected Invoices --

A modal appears with file format options.
Choose the template that matches your accounting platform:
QuickBooks Desktop, QuickBooks Online, Sage 50, Sage 300,
or the CSV option for other systems.
-- Choose QuickBooks Desktop --

If your firm uses custom naming conventions,
enter a file name prefix to keep exports organized.
You can also add an internal note so team members know
why this file was generated.
-- Enter File Name Prefix --

Before you export, confirm the Include Already Exported Invoices
toggle is off. That prevents duplicates from landing
in the import queue.

When everything looks good, continue with the export.
-- Click Export --

Job Book compiles the file and downloads it in your browser.
Save it to the shared accounting folder or whichever location
your team uses for import files.

If you ever need to re-export a past invoice,
turn on Include Already Exported Invoices,
select the records, and export the batch again.
Let accounting know so they do not import the set twice.

After the download finishes, record the accounting
reference number if you have one.
You can do this inside the invoice record.
-- Open Invoice --
-- Click Edit --

In the Accounting Reference field, type the identifier
from QuickBooks or Sage.
-- Enter Accounting Reference --

Now check the Processed box to tell Job Book
this invoice has left the building.
-- Check Processed --

Click Save to update the record.
-- Click Save --

Return to the backlog list and you will notice
that invoice is no longer in the Admin tab.
-- Click Back --

Switch to the Processed tab to see it there.
-- Click Processed tab --

Processed invoices are waiting for confirmation
that payment was received.
When the payment arrives, open the invoice again
and mark it Paid.
-- Open Invoice --
-- Click Edit --
-- Check Paid --
-- Click Save --

Once paid, the invoice moves from Processed to the Paid tab,
keeping your history clear and auditable.

Let us talk about how this backlog integrates
with the rest of Job Book.
Every invoice that appears here started life as a DWR entry
or a fixed price request in the Active Job Dashboard.
Project Managers approve the work, then Administrators
use this backlog to export and close the loop.
When you mark an invoice Processed or Paid,
those statuses feed WIP reports and the Active Job Dashboard
so Project Managers see real revenue updates.

Here are some best practices to keep the
Invoice Process Backlog running smoothly.
Clear the Admin tab on a routine schedule
so accounting receives predictable batches.
Before exporting, spot check that Representative Signatures
are present and that expenses are marked processed.
Store exported files in a shared location with a
consistent naming convention such as YYYYMMDD_Client_Batch.
If you process both QuickBooks and Sage exports,
keep a simple log noting what went out and
who imported each batch.
When you need to correct something, uncheck Processed
and the invoice will return to the Admin tab for revision.

Each accounting platform has its own import workflow.
Typically you open the accounting system,
choose the import command, and select the file
that Job Book generated.
Confirm the totals after import so any issues
can be corrected before the next export cycle.

Now open your accounting system. 
Each system has its own import process, but generally you’ll go to File → Import, or a similar menu, and select the file you exported from Job Book.

Once imported, the invoices from Job Book will appear in your accounting system as if they had been created there directly. 
This means your clients, amounts, and line items will all carry over.

Why is this process important?
- It eliminates double entry, saving time and reducing errors.  
- It ensures your accounting system has the most accurate and up-to-date records.  
- It keeps your invoicing process seamless from field work all the way through to accounting.
