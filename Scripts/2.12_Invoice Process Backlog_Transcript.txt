Welcome back to the Job Book How to Use Series.
If this is your first time watching,
remember — each episode builds on the last.

In the previous video,
we created invoices and moved them
through the full invoice lifecycle.

We finished our time-and-materials example,
marked it processed,
and created a fixed-price invoice.

Today, we’ll work inside the Invoice Process Backlog —
the final checkpoint before invoices
leave Job Book and land in accounting.

The Invoice Process Backlog protects cash flow.
It prevents invoices from slipping through the cracks,
keeps exports clean for accounting,
and closes the loop
on everything we prepared earlier
in the DWR and Invoice queues.

I’m logged in as an Administrator.
Only Administrators can process
and export invoices here.

From the main dashboard,
find the Workflow card in the middle row.
-- Click Invoice Process Backlog --

The Invoice Process Backlog
is the processing and exporting center for Job Book.

The grid lists every invoice still in the Admin Queue
that hasn’t been set to processed.

If you’ve watched the DWR Approval Backlog
or DWR Invoice Backlog videos,
this will look very familiar —
and it behaves almost the same way.

I’ll highlight what’s different here.
For everything else,
refer to those earlier videos.

At the top left, you’ll see three main buttons:
Export Selected Invoices,
Download Selected PDFs,
and Process Selected Invoices.
All stay inactive until you’ve checked at least one invoice.

Sorting, filtering, and grouping
work the same as before.

The Invoice Table uses columns
that are more accounting-focused
than the DWR tables.
It lists all invoices still in the Admin Queue
that haven’t yet been processed.

The blue triangle on the left
expands the invoice to show more detail —
again, information that’s aimed at accounting.

To prepare a batch export,
select the invoices you want to send to accounting.
-- Check Invoice Checkbox --

Once you select at least one invoice,
the Export, Download, and Process buttons activate.

Click Export Selected Invoices.
-- Click Export Selected Invoices --

Job Book compiles the selected invoices
and downloads an export file in your browser.
Only the checked invoices are included.

You can now import that file into your accounting system.
Job Book supports multiple formats —
QuickBooks Desktop and Online, Sage 50, Sage 300,
and a generic CSV for other systems.

We have videos that walk you through each import.
You’ll find those links in the description below.

You can also bulk download all invoice PDFs.
Just select the invoices you want,
then click Download Selected PDFs.
-- Click Download Selected PDFs --

A ZIP file downloads with all the PDFs inside.

After you export and import invoices into accounting,
you can mark them processed in bulk.
Click Process Selected Invoices.
-- Click Process Selected Invoices --

A confirmation window appears
showing how many invoices you’ll process.
Click OK.
-- Click OK --

Those invoices disappear from the backlog immediately.
Processing here is the same as checking the Processed box manually,
but you’re doing it for many at once.

If you make a mistake, no problem.
Click Undo Last Process Batch at the top right.
-- Click Undo Last Process Batch --

A confirmation window shows how many invoices you’re unprocessing.
Click OK.
-- Click OK --

All those invoices return to the backlog.

If the Undo button is inactive,
locate the processed invoice manually and uncheck the Processed box.
You can see how to do that in the Creating Invoices video.

Now let’s look at how this backlog fits into the bigger picture.

Every invoice here started as a DWR entry
or a fixed-price job from the Active Job Dashboard.
Project Managers approve the work,
then Administrators use this backlog to export and close the loop.

When you mark an invoice Processed or Paid,
those statuses feed into WIP Reports and the Active Job Dashboard,
so Project Managers see real-time revenue updates.

Here are a few best practices to keep things running smoothly:

Clear the Admin Queue on a regular schedule
so accounting receives predictable batches.

Before exporting, spot-check that Representative Signatures are present
and that expenses are marked processed.

If you need to make a correction,
uncheck Processed and the invoice returns to the Admin Queue.

Each accounting platform has its own import workflow.
Usually you’ll open your accounting software,
choose Import, and select the file Job Book generated.
Always confirm totals after import
so you can fix issues before the next cycle.

Once imported, record the accounting reference number if available.
You can add it inside the invoice record under Accounting Reference.
That lets you cross-reference Job Book invoices
with entries in your accounting system.

After import, the invoices appear in your accounting software
as if they were created there directly —
complete with clients, amounts, and line items.

Why is this process so important?

It eliminates double entry.
It saves time and reduces errors.
It keeps your records accurate and up to date,
and it makes your invoicing workflow seamless
from field work all the way to accounting.

In the next video,
we’ll step back and review the entire How to Use Job Book journey.
We’ll also point you to advanced series covering Reporting, Assets, Safety, and more.

You now know how to monitor the Invoice Process Backlog,
prepare clean exports for accounting,
and close out invoices with confidence.

Thanks for watching, and I’ll see you in the next video!
