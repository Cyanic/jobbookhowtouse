Welcome back to the Job Book How to Use Series.
If this is your first time watching,
remember that each episode builds on the last.

In the previous video, we created invoices
and moved them through the Invoice lifecycle.
We finished our time and materials example,
marked it processed,
and created a fixed price invoice.

Today we will work inside the Invoice Process Backlog.
This backlog will allow you to batch process invoices,
and is the final checkpoint before invoices
leave Job Book and land in accounting.

The Invoice Process Backlog protects cash flow.
It prevents invoices from slipping through the cracks,
keeps exports clean for accounting,
and closes the loop on everything we prepared
in the DWR and invoice queues.

I am logged in as an Administrator.
Only Administrators can process and export invoices here.

From the dashboard, find the Workflow card
near the middle of the second row.
-- Click Invoice Process Backlog --

The Invoice Process Backlog is the 
processing and exporting center for Job Book.

The grid lists every invoice in the Admin Queue  
that has not yet been set to processed. 

If you've watched our 
DWR Approval Backlog video 
or our DWR Invoice Backlog video
earlier in this series.
All of this will look very familiar, 
and it behaves almost exactly the same.

I'll highlight the differences, otherwise see those two previous videos 
for greater details.

At the top left, you’ll see the Export Selected Invoices button.
The Download Selected PDFs button.
And the Process Selected Invoices button.
All will stay inactive until we have at least one Invoice checked.

Sorting, filtering and all controls behave the same as the 
DWR Approval Backlog and DWR Invoice Backlog.

The Invoice Table, has columns that are more accounting centric,
verses what we saw in the DWR Approval Backlog and DWR Invoice Backlog.

The Invoice Table will show all invoices in the system 
that are in the Admin Queue and have not yet been set to processed.

The familiar blue triangle on the left side of the table,
expands the invoice to show more details.

Notice the information on the expanded invoice is 
again more accounting centric.

To prepare a batch export, select the invoices
you want to send to accounting.
-- Check Invoice Checkbox --

When you select at least one invoice, the
Export Selected Invoices button,
the Download Selected PDFs and
the Process Selected Invoices activate.

When you click the Export Selected Invoices button,
Job Book compiles the file and downloads it in your browser.
Only the invoices selected will be exported. 
-- Click Export Selected Invoices --

You can use that exported file to 
import invoices into your accounting system.
Job book can export invoices in various formats
such as: QuickBooks Desktop, QuickBooks Online, 
Sage 50, Sage 300, or the CSV option for other systems.

We have videos showing you have to import Job Book files
to the various accounting platforms. 
Links to those videos in the description below. 

Besides exporting invoices for import into your accounting system.
Job Book also has a way of bulk exporting the PDF invoices. 
To do this, select the invoices you want to export,
and then Click the Download Selected PDFs button.
-- Click Download Selected PDFs --

You will then download a zip file containing 
all the selected invoices in pdf format.

After you have exported the invoices 
and imported them to your accounting system 
you can bulk set those invoices to be processed. 

You can do that by clicking on the Process Selected Invoices button. 
-- Click Process Selected Invoices --

You’ll see a confirmation pop-up showing the number of Invoices you’re about to process. 
Click OK.
-- Click OK --

The selected Invoices have now been processed. 
You’ll notice they disappear from the backlog immediately. 
Processing Invoices means you have checked off the processed checkbox on the invoice. 
It's just like we manually did in the Creating Invoices video in this series, 
except here in the Invoice Process Backlog you can process invoices in bulk. 

If you made a mistake, you have two options. 
The easiest and quickest is to click the 
Undo Last Process Batch button on the top right of the screen. 
-- Click Undo Last Process Batch button --

You’ll see a confirmation pop-up showing the number of Invoices you’re about to unprocess. 
Click OK.
-- Click OK --

You should see all the Invoices return to your backlog.

If you ever need to unprocess an invoice 
and the Undo Last Process Batch is inactive, 
you’ll need to locate the processed invoice manually 
and uncheck the Processed checkbox.
See the Creatung Invoices video 
earlier in this series for details on how to do that. 

Let us talk about how this backlog integrates
with the rest of Job Book.
Every invoice that appears here started life as a DWR entry
or a fixed price request in the Active Job Dashboard.
Project Managers approve the work, then Administrators
use this backlog to export and close the loop.
When you mark an invoice Processed or Paid,
those statuses feed WIP reports and the Active Job Dashboard
so Project Managers see real revenue updates.

Here are some best practices to keep the
Invoice Process Backlog running smoothly.
Clear the Admin tab on a routine schedule
so accounting receives predictable batches.
Before exporting, spot check that Representative Signatures
are present and that expenses are marked processed.
When you need to correct something, uncheck Processed
and the invoice will return to the Admin tab for revision.

Each accounting platform has its own import workflow.
Typically you open the accounting system,
choose the import command, and select the file
that Job Book generated.
Confirm the totals after import so any issues
can be corrected before the next export cycle.

Once imported record the accounting reference number if you have one. 
You can do this inside the invoice record in Job Book.
In the Accounting Reference field, type the identifier
from your accoutning system.
That way you'll be able to reference invoices in Job Book,
with the invoices in your accounting system. 

Once imported, the invoices from Job Book will appear in your accounting system as if they had been created there directly. 
This means your clients, amounts, and line items will all carry over.

Why is this process important?
It eliminates double entry, saving time and reducing errors.  
It ensures your accounting system has the most accurate and up-to-date records.  
It keeps your invoicing process seamless from field work all the way through to accounting.  


In the next video, we will step back
and review the entire Job Book How to Use journey,
then point you to advanced series for reporting,
assets, safety, and more.

You now know how to monitor the Invoice Process Backlog,
prepare clean exports for accounting,
and close out invoices with confidence.
