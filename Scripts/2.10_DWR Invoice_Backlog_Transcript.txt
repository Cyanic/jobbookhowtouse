Welcome back to the Job Book How to Use Series.

In this video, I’ll show you how to use the DWR Invoice Backlog in Job Book.

The DWR Invoice Backlog is where administrators and project managers review invoices before they are finalized and sent to clients. 
It ensures accuracy and prevents billing mistakes.

Let’s take a look.

From the dashboard, locate the Invoice Process Backlog card on the right-hand side. 
Click it to open the backlog.

Here you’ll see a list of all invoices that are waiting for review. 
Each row shows the Job, Client, Invoice Number, Date, and Invoice Amount.

To review an invoice, click on it.

Inside the invoice, you’ll see all the details:
- The client and job information.  
- The line items being billed, including labour, equipment, fixed price items, and expenses.  
- The total invoice amount.  
- The status of each line item, whether approved or pending.  

As an administrator or project manager, your role is to confirm that the invoice is correct. 
Check that line items match the work performed and that expenses have been approved. 
If everything looks correct, click Approve. 
The invoice will then be ready to finalize and send to the client.

If you find an error, you can edit the invoice directly or reject it for correction. 
When rejecting, add a note so the person who created it knows what to fix. 
For example: “Incorrect rate applied to Survey Party Chief line item.”

Approved invoices disappear from the backlog and move into the system as finalized invoices. 
Rejected invoices return for correction.

Why is the Invoice Process Backlog important?
- It ensures invoices are accurate before clients receive them.  
- It prevents billing disputes and delays.  
- It keeps your invoicing workflow organized and transparent.  

That’s how you use the Invoice Process Backlog in Job Book.
