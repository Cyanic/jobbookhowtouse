Welcome back to the Job Book How to Use Series.
If this is your first time watching, remember that each episode builds on the last.

In the previous video we cleared the Expense Approval Backlog.
We matched receipts to jobs, protected reimbursements, and prepared cost data for billing.

Today we are focusing on the DWR Invoice Backlog, the checkpoint where approved
daily work records turn into draft invoices.
It keeps pricing, scope, and timing aligned before anything reaches a client.

Before we press any buttons, here is why this queue matters.
Approved DWRs land here ready for billing, and this review is the last chance to
catch coding or rate issues.
Skipping it invites underbilling, double billing, or sending the wrong details to
a client.
A steady backlog rhythm protects cash flow, keeps job budgets accurate, and
preserves your reputation.

I am logged in as an Administrator.
That role gives me access to every job and every backlog queue.
A project manager would see only the jobs assigned to them, but the workflow is the same.

From the main dashboard look to the right column.
You will find the Invoice Process card that lists billing queues.
-- Click Invoice Process Backlog --

The DWR Invoice Backlog opens in a new tab inside Job Book.
A toolbar across the top holds Approve, Reject, Export, and Refresh.
Below it a filter bar lets you search by client, job, date range, or invoice
number, and the grid lists each draft invoice waiting for review with its job,
client, billing period, total, and status.

You can sort any column by clicking the header.
-- Sort by Job --
Sorting moves related invoices together so you can clear one project at a time,
and dragging a column into the grouping bar lets you review one client or job in
sequence.

Filters keep you focused when the backlog grows.
-- Apply Filter --
Use the filter funnel next to Client, start typing the client name, or filter by
Job Number or Ready By date when you are working toward a billing deadline.

Let us open one of the invoices in the backlog.
-- Open Invoice Detail --
A drawer slides in with a detailed preview that shows billing metadata, grouped
line items, and totals.
Labour lines list the role, hours, rate sheet, and amount; equipment, materials,
and disbursements follow the same pattern so you can confirm pricing fast.
Expenses we approved in the previous episode display here too, so you can scan
for missing costs without leaving the screen.
If the total looks off, use View DWRs to compare against the source records.
-- View Source DWRs --

You can edit line details from this screen when you need small adjustments.
-- Edit Line Item --
Adjust quantities, descriptions, or rate sheet items when something minor needs
refinement, and Job Book logs the change in the audit trail.
-- Add Internal Note --
Use internal notes to flag follow ups for other reviewers, and add a client note
if the final invoice should include context like a purchase order reference.

When the invoice looks right, tick its checkbox in the grid.
-- Select Invoice --
The Approve button activates immediately.
-- Approve Invoice --
Confirm the prompt and the invoice leaves the backlog for the Ready to Send list
where your accounting team can email, print, or export it.

If you find a bigger issue, choose Reject.
-- Reject Invoice --
Give a clear instruction so the drafter knows what to fix, and the invoice will
stay hidden from the client until it returns.

You can work in batches too.
-- Multi Select Invoices --
Select several rows that share the same status and approve them together; if a
correction is needed later, unapprove the specific invoice and it returns to the
backlog.

Reporting teams rely on the Export button when leadership wants a billing snapshot.
-- Export Grid --
It downloads the current view with your filters intact for quick email updates.

Let us talk about how this backlog fits into the broader Job Book process.
Approved DWRs flow here after the DWR Approval Backlog.
Once you approve invoices they move into the invoicing module for final
delivery, and the Active Job Dashboard updates so budget to actual reporting
stays accurate.
Rejected invoices keep their DWR approvals but park here until someone rebuilds them.

Here are a few habits that keep this queue healthy.
Schedule a weekly billing review with project managers, use client grouping
during month end so each customer gets a tidy package, document partial invoices
with internal notes, and finish every session with a quick scan for returned
items.

Before we wrap up, let me recap.
We opened the Invoice Process Backlog, reviewed the grid controls, drilled into
invoice details, and made targeted edits.
We approved clean invoices, rejected the ones that needed fixes, and exported a
billing snapshot while keeping the workflow connected to the rest of Job Book.

In the next episode we will step into the Creating Invoices module.
We will build invoices from scratch, combine backlog items, and look at how
those invoices move to accounting.

Thanks for watching, and I will see you in the next video.
