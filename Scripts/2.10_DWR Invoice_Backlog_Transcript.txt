Welcome back to the Job Book How to Use Series. 
If this is your first time watching, 
remember that each episode builds on the last.

In the previous video, we cleared the Expense Approval Backlog so
reimbursements and job costs stayed accurate. Those approved expenses now wait
alongside labour in the billing pipeline.

Today, we’ll focus on invoicing the client. 
In Job Book, there are two types of invoices.
Fixed price invoices, where the client is charged a fixed amount for the service.
And time-and-materials invoices, where the client is charged 
based on the actual time spent and materials used during the project.

Time-and-materials invoices are labour intensive to create 
because they require careful tracking of all hours worked 
and materials used during the project. Missing Daily Work Records on an invoice 
means lost revenue and delays cash flow.

Thankfully, Job Book simplifies the invoicing process 
by automatically collecting all approved DWRs 
for jobs set to Time and Materials.
So it's easy to generate draft Invoices 
for final approval from a Project Manager.
To do this we will use the DWR Invoice Backlog. 
And in this video we will focus on the DWR Invoice Backlog. 
Getting this step right keeps billing accurate, 
clients confident, and cash flow predictable.

Why does the DWR Invoice Backlog matter? 
Every approved DWR represents work your team has already delivered.
Until you convert that work into an invoice,
revenue sits in limbo. This backlog is the last review before totals, rates,
and descriptions reach a client. Skipping it risks underbilling, double
billing, or sending the wrong detail trail to accounting.

I’m logged in as an Administrator. 
Typically, an Administrator converts DWRs for Time and Material jobs 
into draft invoices for Project Managers to review and approve.

From the main dashboard, look at the Workflow card 
in the middle of the second row. 
This is where billing queues live for administrators.

-- Click DWR Invoice Backlog --
The DWR Invoice Backlog is the time-and-materials 
invoice creation center for Job Book.

The grid lists every approved DWR that belongs to a time-and-material job 
that has not yet been invoiced. 

If you've watched our DWR Approval Backlog video earlier in this series.
All of this will look very familiar, 
and it behaves almost exactly the same.

At the top left, you’ll see the Invoice Selected DWRs button.
It will stay inactive until we have at least one DWR checked.
At the top right, you’ll see the Expand All, Collapse All buttons

Below that is the grouping bar. 
You can drag column headers here 
to group jobs by Job Number, Project Manager, or other fields.

Below that is the DWR Table, 
which shows all DWRs in the system that have not yet been invoiced.

The first column is a checkbox. 
Clicking the checkbox in the header selects all DWRs for bulk invoice generation. 
Unchecking it clears all selections.

Next are the Date, Created By, and DWR Number columns. 
The DWR Number column contains hyperlinks to the individual DWRs.

Then you have the Job Number, Client, Project Manager, and Office columns.

Sorting and filtering is done just like the DWR Approval Backlog.
Watch the DWR Approval Backlog video earlier in this series 
if you want to learn more about how sorting and filtering works.

Just like the DWR Approval Backlog there is the familiar blue triangle 
on the left side of the table. 
Clicking it, expands the DWR to show more details.

The Expand All and Collapse All work just like the DWR Approval Backlog.

After you’ve reviewed the DWRs, check the boxes for the DWRs you want to 
generate an invoice for. 
The Invoice Selected DWRs button will become active. 

To generate an invoice, click the Invoice Selected DWRs button.
If you select DWRs for multiple different jobs, 
each unique job will generate its own invoice.
-- Click Invoice Selected DWRs --

You’ll see a confirmation pop-up showing the number of DWRs 
you’re about to turn into an invoice. 
Click OK.
-- Click OK --

The selected DWRs have now gererated an Invoice.
You’ll notice the DWRs disappear from the backlog immediately. 

You’ll also see a green popup showing the invoice number 
and which job it was created for.
There is a button you can click on that will take you 
right to the generated Invoice.
If you click the button a new tab will open to the Invoice created. 
-- Click here to access new Invoice --

If you made a mistake while generating the invoice, don’t worry. 
If you delete an invoice generated from the DWR Invoice Backlog, 
the DWRs used to create that invoice will return to the backlog 
for review. 

Let me show you.
-- Click Delete --
-- Click Delete --
This will take you to the Job Book Dashboard, 
so I'll go back to the DWR Invoice Backlog.
-- Click DWR Invoice Backlog --

As you can see the DWRs we used to create the Invoice that we just deleted 
are now back in the DWR Invoice Backlog. 

When you generate an invoice using the DWR Invoice Backlog, 
all invoices go to the Invoices card 
and enter the PM Queue for Project Manager review.

We will do a deep dive on the Invoice process in the next video. 

For now, let's connect the dots. Field teams create DWRs. Project
managers approve them in their respective backlogs. Administrators convert
approved DWRs into invoices here. Project managers sign the drafts,
administrators deliver them, and the Active Job Dashboard stays current the
entire time.

A few best practices make the DWR Invoice Backlog run smoothly:

Schedule a dedicated billing block every week. 
When the queue never grows stale, clients see timely invoices 
and cash flow stabilizes.

Use the grouping bar or filter to process one client at a time 
during month end.
Sending a unified package per client reduces back-and-forth questions.

After each billing session, refresh the grid 
and double-check that you haven’t missed anything.
Anything still in the backlog should have a clear plan to move forward.

Before we wrap up, here’s a quick recap. 
We opened the DWR Invoice Backlog 
and reviewed the supporting DWR data. 
We converted selected DWRs into invoices 
ready for Project Managers to review in the PM Queue. 
Each step keeps the path from field work to revenue clear and controlled.

In the next episode, we’ll stay in the invoicing workflow 
and build invoices from scratch. 
You’ll see how to handle fixed-price jobs, edit draft documents, 
and tailor invoice formats before sending them to clients.

Thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next video!
