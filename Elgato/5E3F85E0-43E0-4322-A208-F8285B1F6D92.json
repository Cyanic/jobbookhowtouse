        "Welcome back to the \nJob Book How to Use Series.",
        "If you’re just joining,\nmake sure you’ve watched\nthe earlier episodes\nbecause each one builds\non the last.\n\nIn the previous video,\nI showed you how to\ncreate DWRs.",
        "In this video,\nI’ll show you how to\ncreate expenses in Job Book.\n\nExpenses are out of pocket \ncosts your staff pay \nand need to be \nreimbursed for.\n\nIf your company relies\non corporate credit cards,\nyou might have fewer \npersonal expenses to submit.\n\nBut when you pay \nout of pocket,\nthis is where the Expenses \nworkflow keeps everything\norganized.\n\nSubmit expenses as promptly \nas possible.\n\nSubmitting quickly keeps\nthe reimbursement cycle\nshort and gives managers\na real time picture \nof job costs.",
        "I’m logged in as a Technician,\nbut project managers and\nadministrators can follow \nthe same process.",
        "From the dashboard,\nlook for the Expenses card.",
        "Click Create New.\n\n-- Click Create New --",
        "The expense form opens.\nLet’s go through it from\ntop to bottom.",
        "Date is the first field\nand defaults to today’s date.\n\nSet this to the day the\npurchase happened.\n\nExpenses should reflect\nthe transaction date,\neven if you’re filing\nlater in the week.\n\nCreate one expense for\neach payment or receipt.",
        "The Employee field is next.\n\n-- Click Employee dropdown --\n\nThe logged in employee\nappears by default,\nbut you can also file an\nexpense for someone else\nif needed.\n\nI’ll leave it as myself for now.",
        "Below the Employee field\nis the Job field.\n\n-- Click Job dropdown --\n\nPick the job that\ngenerated the expense.\n\nI’ll choose \n“Boundary Survey - 5th Avenue” \nthe same project we used\nin the DWR episode.\n\nBest practice is to match\nthe expense to the job \nit applies to.\n\nThat keeps budgets aligned\nand avoids rework at \napproval time.",
        "Let’s move to \nthe Expense Item dropdown.\n\n-- Click Expense Item --\n\nThe Expense Item dropdown\nshows the expense types\nset up by your administrators.\n\nAccommodations,\nField Allowance,\nField Materials Misc,\nGas,\nMisc,\nand more.\n\nI’ll select “Gas.”",
        "Enter the \nTotal Expense Amount.\n\n-- Type \"78.54\" --\n\nI’ll enter seventy eight dollars \nand fifty four cents.\n\nIt matches the amount on\nthe receipt.",
        "For the Description,\nadd a quick note that explains \nthe purchase,\nsuch as \n“Filled unit 204 after Boundary Survey\ncrew shift.”\n\nDetailed notes save time\nwhen managers or auditors\nreview the record later.",
        "After Description there is\nthe Attachments button.\nWhen you click the\nAttachments button,\n\n-- Click Attachments --\n\nyou’ll be able to take a\npicture of the receipt\nwith your cellphone.\n\nOr if you are on a\ncomputer you can click\nthe Select File button \nto upload a file.",
        "Attach photos or PDFs of \nevery receipt.\n\nJob Book stores them with\nthe record so approvers\nand auditors don’t have to\nchase you later.\n\nTake a photo of the \nreceipt as soon as you get \nback to the truck and\nupload it while you have a\ngood connection.",
        "Many teams also add a\nphoto of the signed hotel\nfolio as a second backup.\n\nMore documentation means\nfaster approvals.",
        "Finally there is the\nSubmitted checkbox.",
        "If you’re still gathering \nreceipts,\nuncheck Submitted and you\ncan save a draft expense.\n\nDraft expenses remain in\nyour My Expenses list,\nand they don’t post to\napprovals until you\nfinalize them.\n\nI’ll uncheck Submitted.",
        "When you click Save,\nJob Book checks that all\nrequired fields are filled in \nbefore saving.\n\nIf anything is missing,\nJob Book will highlight\nthe field in red.\n\nSimply fix the items,\nthen click Save again.\n\n-- Click Save --",
        "This will take you back to\nthe Dashboard.",
        "To view your Expenses,\nclick on the Explore button \nin the Expenses card.\n\n-- Click Explore --",
        "At the top you’ll see two\ntabs:\nMy Expenses and\nAll My Expenses.",
        "My Expenses shows the\nexpenses you’ve created\nbut not yet submitted for \napproval.\nHere you can see the\nexpense we just created.",
        "The All My Expenses tab\nshows all your expenses.\n\nOnce an expense is \napproved,\nyou’ll only be able to\nview it in this tab.\n\nYou can not edit expenses\nin this tab.",
        "Let’s go ahead and submit\nthe expense we just created.\n\nTo do that,\nclick on the expense.",
        "There are four buttons on\nthe top of the display\nscreen.\n\nEdit,\nExport to PDF,\nDelete,\nand Back.",
        "The Edit button will allow you \nto edit the expense.\n\nThe Export to PDF button\nmakes a file you can print\nor email if needed.\n\nThe Delete button will\ndelete the expense and \nthe Back button will take you\nback to the display screen.",
        "For now click the Edit button \nso we can submit \nthe expense.\n\n-- Click Edit --",
        "Here you can edit whatever\ninformation you like.\n\nWhen everything is\ncomplete and accurate,\ncheck the Submitted box\nand save.\n\nThis sends the expense to\nyour administrator for \napproval in the \nExpense Approval Backlog.",
        "Notice the Submitted Date\nis date stamped when the\nexpense was submitted.\n\n-- Click Save --",
        "Once saved,\nclick the Back button.\n\n-- Click Back --",
        "You’ll notice on the\nExplore list \nyour expense is gone.\n\nThat’s because you are in\nthe My Expenses tab.\n\nIf you click on the All My\nExpenses tab,\n\n-- Click All My Expenses --\n\nYou should see your\nexpense waiting to be\napproved by a project\nmanager.",
        "That’s about everything\nyou need to know to create\nexpenses in Job Book.",
        "If you’re an administrator,\ncheck out our \nExpense Approval Backlog \nvideo,\nto see how to approve \nexpenses from your point\nof view.",
        "You can also watch our DWR\nInvoice Backlog video,\nto learn how administrators \nturn approved DWRs \ninto invoices.",
        "Before we wrap up,\nhere are a few best practices \nto keep \nexpense processing smooth.\n\nSubmit expenses daily\nor at least weekly \nso approvers have \nfresh details and you get\nreimbursed faster.\n\nMatch expenses to the\nsame job you used on\nyour DWR to keep\nbudgets accurate and\navoid billing delays.\n\nUpload receipts right\naway.\n\nFaded or missing copies\nslow approvals and can\njeopardize reimbursement.\n\nUse meaningful descriptions \nso approvers understand how\nthe purchase supported \nthe job without calling you.\n\nReview your totals \nbefore submitting.\n\nFixing small errors now\nprevents a manager from\nrejecting the expense later.",
        "By following these habits,\nexpenses move through\napprovals quickly,\nyou get reimbursed on time,\nand project costs stay\naccurate for dashboards\nand invoices.",
        "That’s everything you need\nto know to create expenses\nin Job Book.",
        "In the next video,\nwe’ll switch to the\nproject manager role and\nexplore \nthe Active Job Dashboard,\nwhere you can monitor\nbudgets,\nprogress,\nand upcoming deadlines\nat a glance.",
