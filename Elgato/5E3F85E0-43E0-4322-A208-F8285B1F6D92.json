        "Welcome back to the Job Book How\nto Use Series.",
        "If you’re just joining, make\nsure you’ve watched the earlier\nepisodes because each one builds\non the last. In the previous\nvideo, I showed you how to\ncreate DWRs.",
        "In this video, I’ll show you how\nto create expenses in Job Book.\nExpenses are out-of-pocket costs\nyour staff pay and need to be\nreimbursed for. If your company\nrelies on corporate credit\ncards, you might have fewer\npersonal expenses to submit. But\nwhen you do pay out of pocket,\nthis is where the Expenses\nworkflow keeps everything\norganized. Submit expenses as\npromptly as possible. Submitting\nquickly keeps the reimbursement\ncycle short and gives managers a\nreal-time picture of job costs.",
        "I’m logged in as a Technician,\nbut project managers and\nadministrators can follow the\nsame process.",
        "From the dashboard, look for the\nExpenses card.",
        "Click Create New\n-- Click Create New --",
        "The expense form opens. Let’s go\nthrough it from top to bottom.",
        "Date is the first field and\ndefaults to today's date. Set\nthis to the day the purchase\nhappened. Expenses should\nreflect the transaction date,\neven if you’re filing them later\nin the week. Create one expense\nfor each payment or receipt.",
        "The Employee field is next.\n-- Click Employee dropdown --\nThe logged-in employee appears\nby default, but you can also\nfile an expense for someone else\nif needed. I’ll leave it as\nmyself for now.",
        "Below the Employee field is the\nJob field.\n-- Click Job dropdown --\nPick the job that generated the\nexpense. I’ll choose “Boundary\nSurvey - 5th Avenue,” the same\nproject we used in the DWR\nepisode. Best practice is to\nmatch the expense to the job it\napplies to. That keeps budgets\naligned and avoids rework at\napproval time.",
        "Let’s move to the Expense Item\ndropdown.\n-- Click Expense Item --\nThe Expense Item dropdown shows\nthe expense types set up by your\nadministrators. Accommodations,\nField Allowance, Field Materials\nMisc, Gas, Misc, and more.",
        "I’ll select “Gas.”",
        "Enter the Total Expense Amount.\n-- Type \"78.54\" --\nI’ll enter seventy-eight dollars\nand fifty-four cents, the amount\nshown on the receipt.",
        "For the Description, add a quick\nnote that explains the purchase,\nsuch as “Filled unit 204 after\nBoundary Survey crew shift.”\nDetailed notes save time when\nmanagers or auditors review the\nrecord later.",
        "After Description there is the\nAttachments button. When you\nclick the Attachments button,\n-- Click Attachments --\nyou'll be able to take a picture\nof the receipt with your\ncellphone. Or if you are on a\ncomputer you can click the\nSelect File button to upload a\nfile.",
        "Attach photos or PDFs of every\nreceipt. Job Book stores them\nwith the record so approvers and\nauditors don’t have to chase you\nlater. Take a photo of the\nreceipt as soon as you get back\nto the truck and upload it while\nyou have a good connection.",
        "Many teams also add a photo of\nthe signed hotel folio as a\nsecond backup. More\ndocumentation means faster\napprovals.",
        "Finally there is the Submitted\ncheckbox.",
        "If you’re still gathering\nreceipts, uncheck Submitted and\nyou can save a draft expense.\nDraft expenses remain in your My\nExpenses list, and they don’t\npost to approvals until you\nfinalize them. I'll uncheck\nSubmitted.",
        "When you click Save, Job Book\nchecks that all required fields\nare filled in before saving. If\nanything is missing, Job Book\nwill highlight the field in red.\nSimply fix the items, then click\nSave again.\n-- Click Save --",
        "This will take you back to the\nDashboard.",
        "To view your Expenses click on\nthe Explore button in the\nExpenses card.\n-- Click Explore --",
        "At the top you’ll see two tabs:\nMy Expenses and All My Expenses.",
        "My Expenses shows the expenses\nyou’ve created but not yet\nsubmitted for approval. Here you\ncan see the expense we just\ncreated.",
        "The All My Expenses tab shows\nall your expenses. Once an\nexpense is approved, you’ll only\nbe able to view it in this tab.\nYou can not edit expenses in\nthis tab.",
        "Let's go ahead and submit the\nExpense we just created. To do\nthat click on the expense.",
        "There are four buttons on the\ntop of the Display screen. Edit,\nExport to PDF, Delete, and Back.",
        "The Edit button will allow you\nto edit the Expense. The Export\nto PDF button makes a file you\ncan print or email if needed.\nThe Delete button will delete\nthe Expense and the Back button\nwill take you back to the\ndisplay screen.",
        "For now click the Edit button so\nwe can submit the Expense.\n-- Click Edit --",
        "Here you can edit whatever\ninformation you like. When\neverything is complete and\naccurate, check the Submitted\nbox and save. This sends the\nexpense to your administrator\nfor approval in the Expense\nApproval Backlog.",
        "Notice the Submitted Date is\ndate-stamped when the expense\nwas submitted.",
        "-- Click Save --\nOnce saved click the Back button\n-- Click Back --",
        "You'll notice on the Explore\nlist your Expense is gone.\nThat's because you are in the My\nExpenses tab. If you click on\nthe All My Expenses tab\n-- Click All My Expenses --\nYou should see your expense\nwaiting to be approved by a\nproject manager.",
        "That’s about everything you need\nto know to create expenses in\nJob Book.",
        "If you’re an administrator,\ncheck out our Expense Approval\nBacklog video, to see how to\napprove expenses from your point\nof view.",
        "You can also watch our DWR\nInvoice Backlog video, to learn\nhow administrators turn approved\nDWRs into invoices.",
        "Before we wrap up, here are a\nfew best practices to keep\nexpense processing smooth.\nSubmit expenses daily or at\nleast weekly so approvers have\nfresh details and you get\nreimbursed faster. Match\nexpenses to the same job you\nused on your DWR to keep budgets\naccurate and avoid billing\ndelays. Upload receipts right\naway. Faded or missing copies\nslow down approvals and can\njeopardize reimbursement. Use\nmeaningful descriptions so\napprovers understand how the\npurchase supported the job\nwithout calling you. Review your\ntotals before submitting. Fixing\nsmall errors now prevents a\nmanager from rejecting the\nexpense later.",
        "By following these habits,\nexpenses move through approvals\nquickly, you get reimbursed on\ntime, and project costs stay\naccurate for dashboards and\ninvoices.",
        "That’s everything you need to\nknow to create expenses in Job\nBook.",
        "In the next video, we’ll switch\nto the project manager role and\nexplore the Active Job\nDashboard, where you can monitor\nbudgets, progress, and upcoming\ndeadlines at a glance.",
        "Thanks for watching, and I’ll\nsee you in the next episode!"
