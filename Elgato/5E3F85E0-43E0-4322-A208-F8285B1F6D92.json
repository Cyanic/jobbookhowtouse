        "Welcome back to Job Book\nHow to Use Series.",
        "If you’re just joining,\nmake sure you’ve watched\nthe earlier episodes\nbecause each one builds\non the last.\n\nIn the previous video,\nI showed you how to\ncreate DWRs.",
        "In this video,\nI’ll show you how to\ncreate expenses in\nJob Book.\n\nExpenses are out of\npocket costs your staff\npay and need to be\nreimbursed for.\n\nIf your company relies\non corporate credit\ncards, you might have\nfewer personal\nexpenses to submit.\n\nBut when you do pay\nout of pocket, this is\nwhere the Expenses\nworkflow keeps\neverything organized.\n\nSubmit expenses as\npromptly as possible.\n\nSubmitting quickly keeps\nthe reimbursement cycle\nshort and gives managers\na real time picture\nof job costs.",
        "I’m logged in as a\nTechnician,\nbut project managers\nand administrators can\nfollow the same\nprocess.",
        "From the dashboard,\nlook for the Expenses\ncard.",
        "Click Create New.\n\n-- Click Create New --\n",
        "The expense form opens.\nLet’s go through it\nfrom top to bottom.",
        "Date is the first field\nand defaults to today’s\ndate.\nSet this to the day\nthe purchase happened.\nExpenses should reflect\nthe transaction date,\neven if you’re filing\nthem later in the week.\nCreate one expense for\neach payment or receipt.",
        "The Employee field is\nnext.\n\n-- Click Employee dropdown --\n\nThe logged in employee\nappears by default,\nbut you can also file\nan expense for someone\nelse if needed.\nI’ll leave it as myself\nfor now.",
        "Below the Employee field\nis the Job field.\n\n-- Click Job dropdown --\n\nPick the job that\ngenerated the expense.\nI’ll choose “Boundary\nSurvey - 5th Avenue,”\nthe same project we\nused in the DWR\nepisode.\nBest practice is to\nmatch the expense to the\njob it applies to.\nThat keeps budgets\naligned and avoids\nrework at approval time.",
        "Let’s move to the\nExpense Item dropdown.\n\n-- Click Expense Item --\n\nThe Expense Item\ndropdown shows the\nexpense types set up by\nyour administrators.\nAccommodations,\nField Allowance,\nField Materials Misc,\nGas, Misc, and more.",
        "I’ll select “Gas.”",
        "Enter the Total Expense\nAmount.\n\n-- Type \"78.54\" --\n\nI’ll enter seventy eight\ndollars and fifty four\ncents, the amount shown\non the receipt.",
        "For the Description, add\na quick note that\nexplains the purchase,\nsuch as “Filled unit 204\nafter Boundary Survey\ncrew shift.”\nDetailed notes save time\nwhen managers or\nauditors review the\nrecord later.",
        "After Description there\nis the Attachments\nbutton.\nWhen you click the\nAttachments button,\n\n-- Click Attachments --\n\nyou’ll be able to take\na picture of the\nreceipt with your\ncellphone.\nOr if you are on a\ncomputer you can click\nthe Select File button\nto upload a file.",
        "Attach photos or PDFs\nof every receipt.\nJob Book stores them\nwith the record so\napprovers and auditors\ndon’t have to chase you\nlater.\nTake a photo of the\nreceipt as soon as you\nget back to the truck\nand upload it while you\nhave a good connection.",
        "Many teams also add a\nphoto of the signed\nhotel folio as a\nsecond backup.\nMore documentation means\nfaster approvals.",
        "Finally there is the\nSubmitted checkbox.",
        "If you’re still\ngathering receipts,\nuncheck Submitted and\nyou can save a draft\nexpense.\nDraft expenses remain\nin your My Expenses\nlist, and they don’t\npost to approvals until\nyou finalize them.\nI’ll uncheck Submitted.",
        "When you click Save,\nJob Book checks that\nall required fields are\nfilled in before\nsaving.\nIf anything is missing,\nJob Book will highlight\nthe field in red.\nSimply fix the items,\nthen click Save again.\n\n-- Click Save --",
        "This will take you back\nto the Dashboard.",
        "To view your Expenses\nclick on the Explore\nbutton in the Expenses\ncard.\n\n-- Click Explore --",
        "At the top you’ll see\ntwo tabs:\nMy Expenses and\nAll My Expenses.",
        "My Expenses shows the\nexpenses you’ve created\nbut not yet submitted\nfor approval.\nHere you can see the\nexpense we just created.",
        "The All My Expenses tab\nshows all your expenses.\nOnce an expense is\napproved, you’ll only be\nable to view it in\nthis tab.\nYou can not edit\nexpenses in this tab.",
        "Let’s go ahead and\nsubmit the expense we\njust created.\nTo do that click on\nthe expense.",
        "There are four buttons\non the top of the\nDisplay screen.\nEdit, Export to PDF,\nDelete, and Back.",
        "The Edit button will\nallow you to edit the\nexpense.\nThe Export to PDF\nbutton makes a file\nyou can print or email\nif needed.\nThe Delete button will\ndelete the expense and\nthe Back button will\ntake you back to the\ndisplay screen.",
        "For now click the Edit\nbutton so we can\nsubmit the expense.\n\n-- Click Edit --",
        "Here you can edit\nwhatever information\nyou like.\nWhen everything is\ncomplete and accurate,\ncheck the Submitted box\nand save.\nThis sends the expense\nto your administrator\nfor approval in the\nExpense Approval\nBacklog.",
        "Notice the Submitted\nDate is date stamped\nwhen the expense was\nsubmitted.",
        "-- Click Save --\n\nOnce saved click the\nBack button.\n\n-- Click Back --",
        "You’ll notice on the\nExplore list your\nexpense is gone.\nThat’s because you are\nin the My Expenses tab.\nIf you click on the\nAll My Expenses tab\n\n-- Click All My Expenses --\n\nYou should see your\nexpense waiting to be\napproved by a project\nmanager.",
        "That’s about everything\nyou need to know to\ncreate expenses in\nJob Book.",
        "If you’re an\nadministrator, check out\nour Expense Approval\nBacklog video,\nto see how to approve\nexpenses from your\npoint of view.",
        "You can also watch our\nDWR Invoice Backlog\nvideo, to learn how\nadministrators turn\napproved DWRs into\ninvoices.",
        "Before we wrap up,\nhere are a few best\npractices to keep\nexpense processing\nsmooth.\n\nSubmit expenses daily\nor at least weekly so\napprovers have fresh\ndetails and you get\nreimbursed faster.\n\nMatch expenses to the\nsame job you used on\nyour DWR to keep\nbudgets accurate and\navoid billing delays.\n\nUpload receipts right\naway. Faded or missing\ncopies slow down\napprovals and can\njeopardize\nreimbursement.\n\nUse meaningful\ndescriptions so\napprovers understand\nhow the purchase\nsupported the job\nwithout calling you.\n\nReview your totals\nbefore submitting.\nFixing small errors now\nprevents a manager\nfrom rejecting the\nexpense later.",
        "By following these\nhabits, expenses move\nthrough approvals\nquickly, you get\nreimbursed on time,\nand project costs stay\naccurate for dashboards\nand invoices.",
        "That’s everything you\nneed to know to create\nexpenses in Job Book.",
        "In the next video,\nwe’ll switch to the\nproject manager role\nand explore the Active\nJob Dashboard,\nwhere you can monitor\nbudgets, progress,\nand upcoming deadlines\nat a glance.",
        "Thanks for watching,\nand I’ll see you in\nthe next episode!"
