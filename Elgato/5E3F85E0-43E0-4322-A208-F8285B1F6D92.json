        "Welcome back to the Job\nBook How to Use Series.",
        "If you’re just joining,\nmake sure you’ve watched\nthe earlier episodes\nbecause each one builds\non the last.\n\nIn the previous video,\nI showed you how to\ncreate DWRs.",
        "In this video,\nI’ll show you how to\ncreate expenses in Job\nBook.\n\nExpenses are out of\npocket costs your staff\npay and need to be\nreimbursed for.\n\nIf your company relies\non corporate credit\ncards,\nyou might have\nfewer personal expenses\nto submit.\n\nBut when you pay out of\npocket,\nthis is where\nthe Expenses workflow\nkeeps everything\norganized.\n\nSubmit expenses as\npromptly as possible.\n\nSubmitting quickly keeps\nthe reimbursement cycle\nshort and gives managers\na real time picture\nof job costs.",
        "I’m logged in as a\nTechnician,\nbut project managers and\nadministrators can\nfollow the same\nprocess.",
        "From the dashboard,\nlook for the Expenses\ncard.",
        "Click Create New.\n\n-- Click Create New --\n\n",
        "The expense form opens.\nLet’s go through it from\ntop to bottom.",
        "Date is the first field\nand defaults to today’s\ndate.\nSet this to the day the\npurchase happened.\nExpenses should reflect\nthe transaction date,\neven if you’re filing\nlater in the week.\nCreate one expense for\neach payment or receipt.",
        "The Employee field is\nnext.\n\n-- Click Employee dropdown --\n\nThe logged in employee\nappears by default,\nbut you can also file an\nexpense for someone else\nif needed.\nI’ll leave it as myself\nfor now.",
        "Below the Employee field\nis the Job field.\n\n-- Click Job dropdown --\n\nPick the job that\ngenerated the expense.\nI’ll choose “Boundary\nSurvey - 5th Avenue,\n” the same project we used\nin the DWR episode.\nBest practice is to match\nthe expense to the job it\napplies to.\nThat keeps budgets aligned\nand avoids rework at\napproval time.",
        "Let’s move to the Expense\nItem dropdown.\n\n-- Click Expense Item --\n\nThe Expense Item dropdown\nshows the expense types\nset up by your\nadministrators.\nAccommodations,\nField Allowance,\nField Materials Misc,\nGas,\nMisc,\nand more.",
        "I’ll select “Gas.”",
        "Enter the Total Expense\nAmount.\n\n-- Type \"78.54\" --\n\nI’ll enter seventy eight\ndollars and fifty four\ncents.\nIt matches the amount on\nthe receipt.",
        "For the Description,\nadd a quick note that\nexplains the purchase,\nsuch as “Filled unit 204\nafter Boundary Survey\ncrew shift.”\nDetailed notes save time\nwhen managers or auditors\nreview the record later.",
        "After Description there is\nthe Attachments button.\nWhen you click the\nAttachments button,\n\n-- Click Attachments --\n\nyou’ll be able to take a\npicture of the receipt\nwith your cellphone.\nOr if you are on a\ncomputer you can click\nthe Select File button to\nupload a file.",
        "Attach photos or PDFs of\nevery receipt.\nJob Book stores them with\nthe record so approvers\nand auditors don’t have to\nchase you later.\nTake a photo of the\nreceipt as soon as you get\nback to the truck and\nupload it while you have a\ngood connection.",
        "Many teams also add a\nphoto of the signed hotel\nfolio as a second backup.\nMore documentation means\nfaster approvals.",
        "Finally there is the\nSubmitted checkbox.",
        "If you’re still gathering\nreceipts,\nuncheck Submitted and you\ncan save a draft expense.\nDraft expenses remain in\nyour My Expenses list,\nand they don’t post to\napprovals until you\nfinalize them.\nI’ll uncheck Submitted.",
        "When you click Save,\nJob Book checks that all\nrequired fields are filled\nin before saving.\nIf anything is missing,\nJob Book will highlight\nthe field in red.\nSimply fix the items,\nthen click Save again.\n\n-- Click Save --\n\n",
        "This will take you back to\nthe Dashboard.",
        "To view your Expenses,\nclick on the Explore\nbutton in the Expenses\ncard.\n\n-- Click Explore --\n\n",
        "At the top you’ll see two\ntabs:\nMy Expenses and\nAll My Expenses.",
        "My Expenses shows the\nexpenses you’ve created\nbut not yet submitted for\napproval.\nHere you can see the\nexpense we just created.",
        "The All My Expenses tab\nshows all your expenses.\nOnce an expense is\napproved,\nyou’ll only be able to\nview it in this tab.\nYou can not edit expenses\nin this tab.",
        "Let’s go ahead and submit\nthe expense we just\ncreated.\nTo do that,\nclick on the expense.",
        "There are four buttons on\nthe top of the display\nscreen.\nEdit,\nExport to PDF,\nDelete,\nand Back.",
        "The Edit button will allow\nyou to edit the expense.\nThe Export to PDF button\nmakes a file you can print\nor email if needed.\nThe Delete button will\ndelete the expense and the\nBack button will take you\nback to the display\nscreen.",
        "For now click the Edit\nbutton so we can submit\nthe expense.\n\n-- Click Edit --\n\n",
        "Here you can edit whatever\ninformation you like.\nWhen everything is\ncomplete and accurate,\ncheck the Submitted box\nand save.\nThis sends the expense to\nyour administrator for\napproval in the Expense\nApproval Backlog.",
        "Notice the Submitted Date\nis date stamped when the\nexpense was submitted.",
        "-- Click Save --\n\nOnce saved,\nclick the Back button.\n\n-- Click Back --\n\n",
        "You’ll notice on the\nExplore list your expense\nis gone.\nThat’s because you are in\nthe My Expenses tab.\nIf you click on the All My\nExpenses tab,\n\n-- Click All My Expenses --\n\nYou should see your\nexpense waiting to be\napproved by a project\nmanager.",
        "That’s about everything\nyou need to know to create\nexpenses in Job Book.",
        "If you’re an\nadministrator,\ncheck out our Expense\nApproval Backlog video,\nto see how to approve\nexpenses from your point\nof view.",
        "You can also watch our DWR\nInvoice Backlog video,\nto learn how\nadministrators turn\napproved DWRs into\ninvoices.",
        "Before we wrap up,\nhere are a few best\npractices to keep expense\nprocessing smooth.\n\nSubmit expenses daily\nor at least weekly so\napprovers have fresh\ndetails and you get\nreimbursed faster.\n\nMatch expenses to the\nsame job you used on\nyour DWR to keep\nbudgets accurate and\navoid billing delays.\n\nUpload receipts right\naway.\nFaded or missing copies\nslow approvals and can\njeopardize\nreimbursement.\n\nUse meaningful\ndescriptions so\napprovers understand how\nthe purchase supported the\njob without calling you.\n\nReview your totals before\nsubmitting.\nFixing small errors now\nprevents a manager from\nrejecting the expense\nlater.",
        "By following these habits,\nexpenses move through\napprovals quickly,\nyou get reimbursed on\ntime,\nand project costs stay\naccurate for dashboards\nand invoices.",
        "That’s everything you need\nto know to create expenses\nin Job Book.",
        "In the next video,\nwe’ll switch to the\nproject manager role and\nexplore the Active Job\nDashboard,\nwhere you can monitor\nbudgets,\nprogress,\nand upcoming deadlines\nat a glance.",
        "Thanks for watching,\nand I’ll see you in the\nnext episode!"
