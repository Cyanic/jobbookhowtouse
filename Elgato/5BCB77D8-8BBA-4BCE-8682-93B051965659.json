        "Welcome back to the Job Book How\nto Use Series. If this is your\nfirst time watching, remember --\neach episode builds on the last.",
        "In the previous video, we\ncreated invoices and moved them\nthrough the full invoice\nlifecycle.",
        "We finished our\ntime-and-materials example,\nmarked it processed, and created\na fixed-price invoice.",
        "Today, we’ll work inside the\nInvoice Process Backlog -- the\nfinal checkpoint before invoices\nleave Job Book and land in\naccounting.",
        "The Invoice Process Backlog\nprotects cash flow. It prevents\ninvoices from slipping through\nthe cracks, keeps exports clean\nfor accounting, and closes the\nloop on everything we prepared\nearlier in the DWR and Invoice\nqueues.",
        "I’m logged in as an\nAdministrator. Only\nAdministrators can process and\nexport invoices here.",
        "From the main dashboard, find\nthe Workflow card in the middle\nrow.\n-- Click Invoice Process Backlog --",
        "The Invoice Process Backlog is\nthe processing and exporting\ncenter for Job Book.",
        "The grid lists every invoice\nstill in the Admin Queue that\nhasn’t been set to processed.",
        "If you’ve watched the DWR\nApproval Backlog or DWR Invoice\nBacklog videos, this will look\nvery familiar -- and it behaves\nalmost the same way.",
        "I’ll highlight what’s different\nhere. For everything else, refer\nto those earlier videos.",
        "At the top left, you’ll see\nthree main buttons: Export\nSelected Invoices, Download\nSelected PDFs, and Process\nSelected Invoices. All stay\ninactive until you’ve checked at\nleast one invoice.",
        "Sorting, filtering, and grouping\nwork the same as before.",
        "The Invoice Table uses columns\nthat are more accounting-focused\nthan the DWR tables. It lists\nall invoices still in the Admin\nQueue that haven’t yet been\nprocessed.",
        "The blue triangle on the left\nexpands the invoice to show more\ndetail -- again, information\nthat’s aimed at accounting.",
        "To prepare a batch export,\nselect the invoices you want to\nsend to accounting.\n-- Check Invoice Checkbox --",
        "Once you select at least one\ninvoice, the Export, Download,\nand Process buttons activate.",
        "Click Export Selected Invoices.\n-- Click Export Selected Invoices --",
        "Job Book compiles the selected\ninvoices and downloads an export\nfile in your browser. Only the\nchecked invoices are included.",
        "You can now import that file\ninto your accounting system. Job\nBook supports multiple formats\n-- QuickBooks Desktop and\nOnline, Sage 50, Sage 300, and a\ngeneric CSV for other systems.",
        "We have videos that walk you\nthrough each import. You’ll find\nthose links in the description\nbelow.",
        "You can also bulk download all\ninvoice PDFs. Just select the\ninvoices you want, then click\nDownload Selected PDFs.\n-- Click Download Selected PDFs --",
        "A ZIP file downloads with all\nthe PDFs inside.",
        "After you export and import\ninvoices into accounting, you\ncan mark them processed in bulk.\nClick Process Selected Invoices.\n-- Click Process Selected Invoices --",
        "A confirmation window appears\nshowing how many invoices you’ll\nprocess. Click OK.\n-- Click OK --",
        "Those invoices disappear from\nthe backlog immediately.\nProcessing here is the same as\nchecking the Processed box\nmanually, but you’re doing it\nfor many at once.",
        "If you make a mistake, no\nproblem. Click Undo Last Process\nBatch at the top right.\n-- Click Undo Last Process Batch --",
        "A confirmation window shows how\nmany invoices you’re\nunprocessing. Click OK.\n-- Click OK --",
        "All those invoices return to the\nbacklog.",
        "If the Undo button is inactive,\nlocate the processed invoice\nmanually and uncheck the\nProcessed box. You can see how\nto do that in the Creating\nInvoices video.",
        "Now let’s look at how this\nbacklog fits into the bigger\npicture.",
        "Every invoice here started as a\nDWR entry or a fixed-price job\nfrom the Active Job Dashboard.\nProject Managers approve the\nwork, then Administrators use\nthis backlog to export and close\nthe loop.",
        "When you mark an invoice\nProcessed or Paid, those\nstatuses feed into WIP Reports\nand the Active Job Dashboard, so\nProject Managers see real-time\nrevenue updates.",
        "Here are a few best practices to\nkeep things running smoothly:",
        "Clear the Admin Queue on a\nregular schedule so accounting\nreceives predictable batches.",
        "Before exporting, spot-check\nthat expenses are marked\nprocessed.",
        "If you need to make a\ncorrection, uncheck Processed\nand the invoice returns to the\nAdmin Queue.",
        "Each accounting platform has its\nown import workflow. Usually\nyou’ll open your accounting\nsoftware, choose Import, and\nselect the file Job Book\ngenerated. Always confirm totals\nafter import so you can fix\nissues before the next cycle.",
        "Once imported, record the\naccounting reference number if\navailable. You can add it inside\nthe invoice record under\nAccounting Reference. That lets\nyou cross-reference Job Book\ninvoices with entries in your\naccounting system.",
        "After import, the invoices\nappear in your accounting\nsoftware as if they were created\nthere directly -- complete with\nclients, amounts, and line\nitems.",
        "Why is this process so\nimportant?",
        "It eliminates double entry. It\nsaves time and reduces errors.\nIt keeps your records accurate\nand up to date, and it makes\nyour invoicing workflow seamless\nfrom field work all the way to\naccounting.",
        "In the next video, we’ll step\nback and review the entire How\nto Use Job Book journey. We’ll\nalso point you to advanced\nseries covering Reporting,\nAssets, Safety, and more.",
        "You now know how to monitor the\nInvoice Process Backlog, prepare\nclean exports for accounting,\nand close out invoices with\nconfidence.",
        "Thanks for watching, and I’ll\nsee you in the next video! And\ndon’t forget to subscribe for\nmore Job Book updates and\nhelpful how-to videos!"
