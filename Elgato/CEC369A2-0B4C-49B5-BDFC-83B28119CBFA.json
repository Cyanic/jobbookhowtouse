        "Welcome back to the Job Book How\nto Use Series. If this is your\nfirst time watching, remember\nthat each episode builds on the\nlast.",
        "In the previous video, we\ngenerated draft invoices from\nthe DWR Invoice Backlog and saw\nhow they move into the Project\nManager queue for sign-off.",
        "Today, we’ll finish that\ntime-and-materials draft invoice\nand build a fixed-price invoice\nfrom scratch.",
        "Invoices are where job tracking\nturns into revenue. Getting the\nnumbers right protects margins,\nbuilds client confidence, and\nkeeps the Active Job Dashboard\nup to date.",
        "I’m logged in as an\nAdministrator.",
        "From the main dashboard, look at\nthe Invoices card, it’s the\nfirst card on the second row.\nThen click Explore.\n-- Click Explore --",
        "This is the Invoice Management\nsection. If you recall from the\nCreating DWRs video earlier in\nthis series, the interface\nshould look familiar -- but\nslightly different.",
        "At the top, you’ll see seven\ntabs. When an invoice is first\ncreated in the DWR Invoice\nBacklog, it starts in the PM\nQueue.",
        "Here you can see the\ntime-and-materials invoice we\ncreated in the previous DWR\nInvoice Backlog video.",
        "Once the invoice is signed off,\nit moves either to the Ticket\nQueue if the job was set to\nTicket / Invoice) or to the\nAdmin Queue.",
        "The Admin Queue is where\ninvoices are processed. Once\nprocessed, they move to the\nProcessed tab.",
        "The final step is setting the\ninvoice to Paid, which moves it\nto the Paid tab.",
        "That’s the lifecycle of an\ninvoice.",
        "The last two tabs are My Forms,\nwhich show all invoices you\ncreated, and finally, the All\ntab.",
        "Below the tabs are the Filter\nSettings and Search bar. Then\nyou’ll see the Create and Export\nto Excel buttons. Finally,\nthere’s the Invoice List,\nshowing Client Name, Job Number,\nProject Name, Date, and Invoice\nNumber.",
        "Let’s open the\ntime-and-materials invoice we\ncreated earlier.\n-- Click Invoice --",

        "Edit lets you modify the\ninvoice.",
        "Export to PDF creates a file you\ncan print or email to a client.",

        "Delete removes the invoice.",
        "Back returns to the list view.",
        "You’ll notice a blue bar saying:\n“This invoice is in the PM Queue\nand needs a Representative\nSignature to proceed.”",
        "Let’s sign off on it to see what\nhappens.\n-- Click Edit --",

        "If expenses were created for\nthis job, you’ll also see an\nExpenses table. If you remember\nfrom the Creating Expenses\nvideo, we created one for this\njob -- and here it is.",
        "You can add expenses to the\ninvoice by adding line items.\nOnce an expense is accounted\nfor, check its box. When you\nsave the invoice, that expense\nbecomes Processed and disappears\nfrom the pending list.",
        "Let’s pretend this expense is\nalready included in labour\ncosts, so we’ll simply check it\noff.",
        "Inside Invoice Details are six\ntabs. The Labour Costs tab lists\nall labour data imported from\nDWRs for this time-and-materials\ninvoice. You can adjust most\nvalues here. Each Amount is\ncalculated as unit cost ×\nquantity.",
        "If you change the quantity of\nhours worked on an invoice, it\ndoes not change the employee’s\npayroll. That means you can\nadjust billing hours without\naffecting what staff are paid.",
        "I’ll scroll through and adjust\nvalues as needed.",
        "Once labour is reviewed, move to\nthe next tab.\n-- Click Equipment and Materials --",
        "You can make similar edits here.\nIf you need to add a charge that\nwasn’t on a DWR, use Add Line\nItem to select the correct entry\nand enter the quantity and rate.",
        "Next tab.\n-- Click Fixed Price --",
        "Because this invoice is for a\ntime-and-materials job, we won’t\nadd any fixed-price items. I’ll\nshow you that later when we\ncreate a lump-sum invoice.",
        "Next tab.\n-- Click Unpriced --",
        "Here you can add unpriced items\n-- for example, notes or\nexplanations for the client.\n-- Type “Here is some text.” --",

        "Below that are the Terms and\nConditions. You can enter terms\nhere if you send invoices\ndirectly from Job Book. Because\nwe export invoices to our\naccounting software, I’ll leave\nthis blank.",
        "Next are the Totals. Each\nsection -- Labour, Equipment &\nMaterials, Fixed Price -- has\nits own subtotal, which updates\nautomatically.",
        "Below Totals is the\nRepresentative Signature. This\nis where the Project Manager or\nAdministrator signs off,\nconfirming the invoice has been\nreviewed and all charges are\naccurate.",
