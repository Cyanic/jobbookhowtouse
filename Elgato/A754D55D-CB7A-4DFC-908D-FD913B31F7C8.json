        "Welcome back to the Job Book How\nto Use Series.",
        "If this is your first time\nwatching, remember that each\nepisode builds on the last.",
        "In the last video, we explored\nthe Active Job Dashboard and\nlearned how to monitor project\nhealth in real time. That\ndashboard helps identify which\njobs need attention.",
        "In this episode, we’ll dive into\nthe DWR Approval Backlog. The\nDWR Approval Backlog is where a\nProject Manager validates the\nwork records that drive every\njob metric.",
        "This episode is all about\nclearing that backlog\nefficiently so approved records\nreach payroll, reporting, and\nbilling without delay.",
        "Before we jump into the screen,\nlet’s review why approvals\nmatter. Daily Work Records, or\nDWRs, capture labour, equipment,\nand materials in a single\nsubmission. Until they’re\napproved, they’re provisional.\nApproving them confirms that the\ninformation is ready for\npayroll, cost tracking, and\ninvoicing.",
        "I’m logged in as a Project\nManager so I can walk you\nthrough the Daily Work Record\napproval flow from end to end.",
        "From the main dashboard, look at\nthe Workflow card in the middle\nof the second row, then click\nthe DWR Approval Backlog button.\n-- Click DWR Approval Backlog --\nThe DWR Approval Backlog is the\nDWR batch approval center for\nevery project.",
        "At the top left, you’ll see the\nApprove Selected DWRs button. It\nwill be inactive until you\nselect DWRs to approve.",
        "At the top right, you’ll see the\nExpand All, Collapse All, and\nUndo Last Approval Batch\nbuttons.",
        "Below that is the grouping bar.\nYou can drag column headers here\nto group jobs by Job Number,\nProject Manager, or other\nfields.",
        "Below that is the DWR Table,\nwhich shows all DWRs in the\nsystem that have not yet been\napproved.",
        "The first column is a checkbox.\nClicking the checkbox in the\nheader selects all DWRs for bulk\napproval. Unchecking it will\ndeselect all DWRs.",
        "Next are the Date, Created By,\nSubmitted Date, and DWR Number\ncolumns. The DWR Number column\ncontains hyperlinks to the\nindividual DWRs.",
        "Then you have the Job Number,\nClient, Project Manager, and\nOffice columns.",
        "By default, DWRs are sorted by\nDate and Job Number in ascending\norder. That means the oldest\nDWRs appear first, and within\neach day, they’re sorted by Job\nNumber.",
        "Multiple columns can be sorted\nat once. If you want to sort by\nonly one column, you’ll need to\nremove sorting from the others\nby clicking the sorted column\nuntil the arrow disappears.",
        "If I want to sort by Client,\nI’ll remove sorting from the Job\nNumber column.\n-- Click Job Number twice --",
        "And from the Date column.\n-- Click Date twice --",
        "Then I’ll click the Client\ncolumn heading.\n-- Click Client once --",
        "When the arrow points up, it’s\nascending. Click again to switch\nto descending.\n-- Click Client once --\nClick once more to remove\nsorting.\n-- Click Client once --",
        "You can also filter data by\nclicking the filter icon or\ntyping in the quick filter field\nin certain columns.",
        "If I’m Lance and only want to\nsee DWRs for jobs I manage, I’ll\nsimply type 'Lance.'\n-- Type 'Lance' --",
        "The dropdown will show a\nfiltered list to choose from.\nSelect the employee.\n-- Click 'Lance L' --",
        "Now all DWRs are filtered to\nProject Manager Lance. You can\nclear the filter by clicking the\nX on the quick filter or the\nClear Filter icon.",
        "More complex filters can be used\nby clicking the filter icon on\nthe column heading.\n-- Click heading filter --",
        "Sometimes a DWR might need a\nsmall adjustment. If it’s just a\ntypo or a minor fix, you can\ncorrect it on the spot. Keep in\nmind that direct edits mean you\nown that change.",
        "If you need a closer look at or\nneed to edit a specific DWR,\nclick the hyperlink.\n-- Click DWR hyperlink --\nA new browser tab will open\nwhere you can review, edit, or\nmanually approve the DWR.\n-- Click DWR Tab --",
        "If the submission needs more\nwork, tell the technician who\nsubmitted the DWR to edit it\ninstead. Technicians can edit\ntheir own DWRs until they’ve\nbeen approved. Be clear about\nwhat needs to change and why.",
        "Approving multiple DWRs one by\none can get cumbersome.\n-- Click DWR Approval Backlog Tab --",
        "You might have noticed a blue\ntriangle on the left side of the\ntable. If you click it, the\nrecord expands to show more\ndetails.",
        "You can expand all DWRs at once\nby clicking the Expand All\nbutton on the top right.",
        "You can see the line items used,\nthe hours, the unit, the\nquantity, and the description.\nThis lets you quickly review\nmultiple records without opening\neach DWR individually.",
        "After you’ve reviewed the DWRs,\ncheck the boxes for the ones you\nwant to approve. The Approve\nSelected DWRs button will become\nactive.",
        "To approve in bulk, click the\nApprove Selected DWRs button.\n-- Click Approve Selected DWRs --",
        "You’ll see a confirmation pop-up\nshowing the number of DWRs\nyou’re about to approve. Click\nOK.\n-- Click OK --",
        "The selected DWRs have now been\napproved. You’ll notice they\ndisappear from the backlog\nimmediately. Approving DWRs\nlocks the records, meaning\nthey’re no longer editable by\nthe technician. Approved DWRs\ncan now be used in the DWR\nInvoice Backlog if the job is\nset to Time and Material, or\ndirectly when creating an\ninvoice.",
        "If you made a mistake, you can\nclick the Undo Last Approval\nBatch button.\n-- Undo Last Approval Batch button --",
        "You’ll see a confirmation pop-up\nshowing the number of DWRs\nyou’re about to unapprove. Click\nOK.\n-- Click OK --",
        "You should see all the DWRs\nreturn to your backlog.",
        "If you ever need to unapprove a\nDWR and the Undo Last Approval\nBatch is inactive, you’ll need\nto locate the approved DWR\nmanually. To do this, go to\nExplore in the Daily Work\nRecords card.\n-- Click Navigate Home, Click Explore DWRs --\nThen go to the All tab.\n-- Click All tab --\nFind the DWR you want to\nunapprove.\n-- Click DWR --\nOpen the DWR for editing.\n-- Click Edit --\nUncheck the PM Approved\ncheckbox, then click Save.\n-- Click Save --\n-- Click Navigate, Home --",
        "That’s about all there is for\nthe DWR Approval Backlog.",
        "If you want to learn more about\nthe DWR Invoice Backlog, check\nout the DWR Invoice Backlog\nvideo later in this series.",
        "Approvals should happen daily or\nat least before payroll cutoff.\nDelays cause payroll issues and\nslow invoicing. Set aside about\nten minutes at the end of each\nday, or first thing in the\nmorning, to clear the queue. It\nkeeps cash flow smooth and gives\nleadership confidence in the job\ndata they review.",
        "Remember that approved DWRs feed\nseveral backlogs in Job Book.\nThey populate the DWR Invoice\nBacklog for Time and Materials\njobs, they feed cost actuals in\nthe job budget view, and they\nroll into payroll exports. A\ncareful review here prevents\nerrors later. Accurate data now\nmeans faster invoicing and fewer\nwrite-offs down the line.",
        "Here’s a quick recap. The DWR\nApproval Backlog is where you\nvalidate every Daily Work Record\nbefore it affects payroll,\nreporting, and invoicing. Check\nthe queue often, use filters to\nfocus, and review each section\ncarefully. Those habits keep\nyour data accurate and your\nprojects on track.",
        "In the next video, we’ll stay in\nthe approvals workflow and walk\nthrough the Expense Approval\nBacklog, so staff expenses are\nprocessed quickly and\nefficiently.",
        "Thanks for watching, and I’ll\nsee you in the next video!",
        "And don’t forget to subscribe\nfor more Job Book updates and\nhelpful how-to videos!"
