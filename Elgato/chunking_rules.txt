Chunking Rules for Elgato JSON Scripts
======================================

Purpose
-------
These notes describe how each `chapters` entry inside the Elgato JSON files should be formatted so the scripts match the teleprompter style used in Episodes 2.1 through 2.3.

Rules
-----
1. Short Clauses per Line
   - Break narration into short clauses (roughly one phrase per line).
   - Avoid paragraphs longer than three or four short lines inside a single JSON string.
   - Wrap narration so each line is no longer than 24 characters, re-breaking sentences as needed while keeping clauses readable.

2. Break After Commas
   - When a clause ends with a comma, insert a line break right after the comma so each clause sits on its own line.
   - Leave the comma at the end of the line (followed by a single space in the JSON so the spoken pacing reflects the pause).

3. Blank Line Pauses
   - Use blank lines (`\n\n`) inside a chapter string to signal a natural pause or topic shift.
   - Start the chapter with blank lines only when the spoken script intentionally pauses before the first words.

4. Isolate Action Cues
   - Keep on screen directions such as `-- Click Create New --`, `-- Click Save --`, and divider lines (`-----`, `--------`) on their own lines.
   - Surround cues with blank lines so they stand out from narration.

5. Preserve Single Thought per Chapter Entry
   - Each JSON string represents one narrative beat (for example a short explanation, a transition, or an instruction set).
   - Do not merge unrelated ideas into the same string, and do not split a single sentence across multiple chapter entries.

6. Normalize Whitespace
   - Replace tabs with spaces and collapse repeated spaces inside sentences.
   - Keep ASCII text only; replace typographic dashes with double hyphen (`--`) if needed.

7. Respect Teleprompter Pacing
   - Maintain the existing order of lines and pauses from the approved episodes.
   - When reflowing text, prioritize readability out loud: one idea per line, intentional pauses, and clear separation before or after cues.

8. Mirror Original Script Breaks
   - Use `Elgato/friendly_names.txt` to match each JSON file with its source transcript in `Scripts/`.
   - Treat the line breaks in the original script as the authoritative guide for where pauses should occur when recreating the chunked narration.
