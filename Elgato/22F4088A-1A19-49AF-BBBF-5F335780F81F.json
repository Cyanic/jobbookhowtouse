        "Welcome back to the Job Book How to Use Series.",
        "This series is for staff who are working with Job Book daily.",
        "If you’re joining mid-series, start at the beginning since each video builds on the one before it.",
        "In the last section, I showed you how to create clients in Job Book. \nIn this video, I’ll show you how to create jobs in Job Book.",
        "Every project your company works on should be created as a job in Job Book. \nJobs tie together clients, offices, project managers, and line items.",
        "Let’s walk through creating a job.",
        "As you may remember from the Dashboard Overview video, only Administrators or Job Coordinators can create jobs.\nSo I'll log in with the Administrator role.",
        "From the dashboard, click the Create New button inside the Jobs Card second from the top left.\n-- Click Create New --",
        "The first field is Job Number. This is required. \nJob Book will automatically generate a number for you, but you can overwrite it with your own company’s numbering system if you prefer.",
        "Next to the Job Number is the Job Number Counter.\nYou can change the counter by unlocking the blue lock button with a click.\nThis unlocks the Job Number Counter so you can set it.\nI'll set this to: \"250001\"\nWhen you click the blue lock button it will lock in the counter.",
        "Notice the Job Number now defaults to the Job Number Counter.",
        "Next is the Client field. \nHere you can either create a new client or pick one from the dropdown list of clients you’ve already created.\nLet’s choose “Acme Corporation” from the list.",
        "For Client Location you have the option of either using the dropdown and selecting a location you previously made for the client, \nor filling in the Client Address at the time of job creation.\nI'll use the dropdown and select: \"Head Office\"",
        "Notice the Client Address is auto-populated with the address we set when we created the client in the previous video.\nHowever, you can manually edit and override the address.",
        "Next is the Project Name. \nLet’s enter the name of our job: “Boundary Survey 5th Avenue”",
        "After that is the Status. This dropdown is required.\nSetting the status and updating the status of the job frequently is considered best practice.\nThat way staff know exactly where jobs are in the workflow. \nI'll select: \"Job Setup\" from the list.",
        "The Add Location button is where you set the job location.\nYou can add multiple locations to a job if needed. \nFor this example, I'll just be adding one location.",
        "-- Click Add Location -- \nClicking the Add Location button will add a location to a job.\nHere we can see:\nLocation Name, this is just a site name.\nMunicipal Address, this is the address the system will try to find on a map. More on that later. \nState or Province\nAnd City.",
        "The Legal Addresses button allows you to include data such as Lot, Block, Plan, and Section, Township, Range, if needed.",
        "I'll go ahead and fill in a location name and municipal address for this job. \n-- PAUSE --",
        "As you can see, I've filled in all the fields.\nYou'll notice the GPS Coordinates are blank.\nIf I click on the Map Display dropdown the system will try to find the municipal address. \n-- CLICK Map Display --",
        "As you can see the system found the address and placed a blue pin on the mark. \nIf you want to move the pin, simply left click anywhere on the map and the pin will move.\nNotice the GPS coordinate also updates.",
        "Below the Add Location button is the Contacts button.\nLike the Add Location button you can add multiple contacts.\n-- Click Add Location --",
        "When you click on the Contact button it will add two fields.\nThe Contact dropdown and the Add to DWR slash Invoice checkbox. \n-- Click Contact dropdown --",
        "The Contact dropdown contains all the contacts we created on the Client.\nYou can pick an existing contact or create a new one.",
        "I'll pick a contact.\nThe Add to DWR slash Invoice checkbox will add that selected contact to the DWR and Invoice.\nSee the creating DWRs and creating Invoices videos in this series for what that looks like.",
        "Below the Add Contact button is the Project Shared Folder.\nMany firms use cloud storage or a share drive to store project data.\nYou can add a link to either so staff can easily access project data.",
        "The next required field is Project Manager. \nEvery job needs a project manager. \nBest practice is for Project Managers to approve DWRs and sign off on invoices for the jobs they’re responsible for.",
        "I'll click on the dropdown and\nSelect: Lance",
        "The next field is Salesperson or Representative.\nJust like Project Manager you can select an employee here.\nIt's not a required field so I'll skip it.",
        "After that you have the Office field.\nThis is a dropdown with all your offices or departments.\nEvery job must be tied to an office. \nIf your company has multiple offices, select the one this project is running out of. \nWhen I click the dropdown notice these are the offices we created in the Job Book Setup Guide.\nI'll pick: \"Head Office\"",
        "The Client Project Number, PO Number, and Subcontract Number fields are self-explanatory, and I'll skip over them.",
        "The PO Amount field is the dollar amount the job is worth.\nThis will be displayed in the Active Job Dashboard. \nMore on that in later videos.",
        "After the Subcontract # you'll see the required field, DWR Billing Type.",
        "In Job Book there are 4 different billing types:\nOverhead, Non-Chargeable, Fixed Price, and Time & Materials",
        "An overhead job is typically work done for internal business operations. \nThink administrative tasks, training, vacation, and similar work.",
        "Non-chargeable jobs often support client work or projects but, for various reasons, cannot or should not be billed to the client.\nExamples include equipment maintenance, internal project work, rework or fixes, and bench time.",
        "A fixed price job, sometimes called a lump sum job, is a job with a set price.",
        "Finally, a time & materials, or T&M job, is a job where you bill the customer based on the time and materials spent on the job.",
        "Under DWR Billing Type, is the Invoice Type field.\nThe options here are Ticket slash Invoice or Invoice.\nMost of the time you will set your job to simply be Invoice.",
        "But sometimes some of your customers might want to see all the hours worked on a job, without the money associated for that work.\nIf that is the case set the job to Ticket slash Invoice.\nWe’ll talk more about this in the invoicing section later in the series.",
        "Next after Invoice Type we have Invoice Line-Item Type.\nDetailed will show an individual breakdown of all the line items on the invoice.\nSummarized will combine identical line items together into one line.",
        "For example, say you did a T&M job and you had a one-man crew working: 8 hours on Monday, 8 hours on Tuesday, and 4 hours on Wednesday.\nIf the invoice was set to detailed it will have 3 lines for each day of work. \nIf the invoice was set to summarized it will have one line saying one man crew, 20 hours.",
        "It might become clearer when you watch the invoicing section in this series.",
        "Next, we have the GL Code Prefix.\nThis is used with accounting systems like Sage when companies want to code jobs for import.",
        "After that is the Job Categories.\nLike client types, here you can tag this job with multiple categories. Doing so will allow you to filter jobs by their categories.\nI'll select: Construction and Engineering",
        "Next there is Job Scope. \nJust like job categories these are more tags you can add to the job. As you can see we have many job scopes you can tag the job with.\nI'll select: Boundary Stake-Out and Commercial Building Construction",
        "If there’s a scope you’d like to use that isn’t on the list, the Job Scope Details field lets you add it.",
        "Order Date and Due Date are fairly self explanatory. \nThe due date will be visible on the Active Job Dashboard.",
        "I'll set the order date September 15th and the due date October 31st.",
        "You can add multiple taxes to the job if applicable.\n-- Click Add --\n-- Click X --",
        "And you can add multiple fees as a percent to the job if needed.\n-- Click Add --\nAn example of a fee would be a percent fee for administration. \n-- Click X --",
        "Additional Fields will create additional fields on the invoice \n-- Click Add --\n-- Click X --",
        "There’s also a Notes field. Use this to store any internal notes about the job.",
        "Next, we have the Rate Sheet. \nYou'll notice the \"Standard Rates\" rate sheet was selected by default. \nThis is because when we created the client, we assigned that rate sheet as the default. \nSo when we created this job for the \"Acme\" client it used the default rate sheet.",
        "You can use a different rate sheet if you like, by simply clicking on the dropdown and selecting a different rate sheet to apply to the job. \nI'll pick: \"Construction Survey\"",
        "The Billable Line Items section consists of a collection of line items.\nThese line items represent the:\nLabour Costs, \n-- Click Equipment & Materials --\nEquipment & Materials, \n-- Click Fixed Price --\nand Fixed Price line items. \n-- Click Labour Costs --",
        "Pick the items your staff will use on this job.\nWhen you select a line item, it pulls the default rate from the system. \nYou can adjust rates for this specific job if needed.\nYou have the option of manually selecting individual line items to add to the job.\nOr you can click the blue Replace Line Items with Rate Sheet button.\nThis will import the rate sheet template we created in the How-to Setup Job Book video series.\n-- Click Replace Line Items with Rate Sheet --",
        "As you can see:\nLabour Costs, \n--Scroll down -- \n-- Click Equipment & Materials --\nEquipment & Materials, \n-- Click Fixed Price --\nand Fixed Price line items. \n--Scroll down --",
        "Have been imported from our \"Construction Survey\" rate sheet.\n-- Click Labour Costs --",
        "You can still manually remove or add line items.\nFor example, for this job it looks like there are two field staff available to work.\nLet's change that. Let's remove the \"Survey Assist\" and \"Party Chief\". You can do that by clicking on the X to the left of the line item.\n-- Click X --\n-- Click X --",
        "Now they are removed but we don't have any field staff line items that people can select and use. Let's add a new line item.\nClick the Add button.\n-- Click Add --",
        "Notice everything is blank. Click on the Cost Item dropdown\nand select: \"1 Man Survey Crew\"",
        "This is the order the line items are in. If you want to change the order, simply click on the arrows to move the line items. \nI'm going to move the \"1 Man Survey Crew\" to the top.",
        "Let's take a look at the Fixed Price tab.\n-- Click Fixed Price --\nThere are a lot of line items here we don't need. \nI'm going to remove all of them besides \"Construction Survey\"",
        "Ok that looks good. Let's go back to the Labour Costs tab.\n-- Click Labour Costs --",
        "Let's take a closer look at the individual line items.\nNotice the \"Unit Cost\" for the \"1 Man Survey Crew\" was automatically set. \nThis number came from the default rate that we set in the How-to Setup Job Book video series.",
        "Let's change that to: \"$160\"",
        "The CAD, Project Manager, and Professional Land Surveyor \"Unit Cost\" was taken from the \"Construction Survey\" rate sheet.\nYou can also override those unit costs but I won't bother.",
        "At this point, you might be wondering about the empty \"Budget Quantity\" fields.",
        "The budget quantity fields are used when estimating the amount of time or quantity a line item will take for a given job.\nEvery job, whether fixed price or T&M, should have an estimate associated with it.\nBest practice is to fill in the budget quantity for each individual line item based on the estimate.\nWe cover budget quantity in more depth in our Job Book Reporting Guide series.",
        "For now, I'm going to fill in the budget quantity for all the line items.",
        "Now that this is done, I'm going to save the job. \nDon't worry if you need to make any changes to the job, you can always go back and edit the job.\n-- Click Save --",
        "Once the job is saved, you'll see the Jobs Item List. It defaults to the Active jobs tab.\nThe Inactive and the All tabs will show you the inactive jobs and all the jobs in the system respectively.",
        "To edit a specific job, simply click the job.\n-- Click Job --",
        "From the job display screen you can edit, export to PDF, close, delete, or return to the job list.\nWe’ll cover cloning and deleting jobs later.",
        "To Edit the job, click the Edit button\n-- Click Edit --",
        "You can go ahead and edit any field you like. Including the Job Number.",
        "At the bottom of the job there is an Active checkbox.",
        "Once a job is completed and invoiced the best practice is to deactivate the job in the system. \nA deactivated job can’t be selected when creating DWRs.\nYou can always reactivate a job if it becomes active again or if you need to assign time to it.",
        "All jobs are still visible in the All tab and still visible in the Job Maps.",
        "Because the system does not allow referenced data to be deleted best practice is to deactivate Jobs instead of deleting them.",
        "Once all your edits are complete remember to click the Save button.\n-- Click Save --",
        "This will take you back to the Job Display screen.",
        "If you click the Clone button, it will create a copy of the job.\nA new Job Number will be assigned.\nThe Status of the job, the PO #, and PO Amount will not be set. \nAll the other data will be copied.",
        "Cloning a job is useful when a project has parts that need to be invoiced separately, \nfor example, projects with multiple phases or different scopes.",
        "I'm going to go ahead and create a few more jobs in the system.\nFeel free to pause the video and create your own jobs.",
        "We’ll use these jobs throughout the rest of the How to Use Job Book series and in future training videos.",
        "-- --",
        "So why are jobs important?\nEvery DWR, expense, and invoice must be tied to a job.  \nJobs give you real-time visibility on project progress.  \nReports and backlogs are organized by job.",
        "For information on Job Reports, \nsee our Job Book Reporting Guide series.",
        "Or click on the link below in the description to learn more.",
        "That’s everything you need to know to start creating and managing jobs in Job Book.",
        "In the next video, I’ll show you how to create Daily Work Records, or DWRs, which your staff will use to record time and materials.",
        "After that, we’ll cover creating Expenses.",
        "Thanks for watching!\nand I'll see you in the next video!"
