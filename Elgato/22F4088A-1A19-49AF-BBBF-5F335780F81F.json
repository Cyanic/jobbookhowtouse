        "\n\n\n\nWelcome back to the \nJob Book How to Use Series.",
        "This series is for staff who are\nworking with Job Book daily.",
        "If you’re joining mid-series,\nstart at the beginning since\neach video builds on the one\nbefore it.",
        "In the last section, I showed\nyou how to create clients in \nJob Book. In this video, I’ll \nshow you how to create jobs \nin Job Book.",
        "Every project your company \nworks on should be created \nas a job in Job Book. \nJobs tie together \nclients, offices, \nproject managers, \nand line items.",
        "Let’s walk through \ncreating a job.",
        "As you may remember from \nthe \nDashboard Overview video, \nonly Administrators \nor Job Coordinators can \ncreate jobs. \nSo I'll log in with the\nAdministrator role.",
        "-----",
        "From the dashboard, click the\nCreate New button inside the\nJobs Card second from \nthe top left.\n-- Click Create New --",
        "The first field is Job Number.\nThis is required. Job Book will\nautomatically generate \na number for you, \nbut you can overwrite it with \nyour own company’s\nnumbering system \nif you prefer.",
        "Next to the Job Number \nis the Job Number Counter. \nYou can change the counter \nby unlocking the blue \nlock button with a click. \nThis unlocks the \nJob Number Counter \nso you can set it. \n\nI'll set this to: \n\"250001\"\n\nWhen you click the \nblue lock button it will \nlock in the counter.",
        "Notice the Job Number \nnow defaults to \nthe Job Number Counter.",
        "Next is the Client field. \nHere you can either create a \nnew client or pick one from \nthe dropdown list of clients \nyou’ve already created. \nLet’s choose\n“Acme Corporation” \nfrom the list.",
        "For Client Location you have \nthe option of either using the\ndropdown and selecting a\nlocation you previously made \nfor the client, or filling in the\nClient Address at the time of\njob creation. \nI'll use the dropdown \nand select: \n\"Head Office\"",
        "Notice the Client Address is\nauto-populated with \nthe address we set when \nwe created the client in \nthe previous video.\n\nHowever, you can manually \nedit and override the address.",
        "Next is the Project Name. \nLet’s enter the name \nof our job:\n“Boundary Survey 5th Avenue”",
        "After that is the Status. \nThis dropdown is required. \nSetting the status \nand updating the status of \nthe job frequently \nis considered best practice. \nThat way staff know exactly \nwhere jobs are \nin the workflow. \nI'll select: \n\"Job Setup\" from the list.",
        "The Add Location button \nis where you set \nthe job location. \nYou can add multiple \nlocations to a job if needed. \n\nFor this example,\nI'll just be adding \none location.\n\n-- Click Add Location --",
        "Clicking the \nAdd Location button\nwill add a location to a job.\n\nHere we can see: \nLocation Name,\n\nthis is just a site name.\n\nMunicipal Address, \nthis is the address \nthe system will try to find on \na map. \nMore on that later. \nState or Province \nand City.",
        "The Legal Addresses button\nallows you to include data \nsuch as Lot, Block, Plan, \nand Section, Township, \nRange, if needed.",
        "I'll go ahead and fill in a\nlocation name and municipal\naddress for this job.\n--------",
        "As you can see, \nI've filled in all the fields. \nYou'll notice the \nGPS Coordinates are blank.\n\nIf I click on the \nMap Display dropdown \nthe system will try to find \nthe municipal address.\n-- CLICK Map Display --",
        "As you can see \nthe system found the address \nand placed a blue pin \non the mark. \nIf you want to move the pin, \nsimply left click anywhere on \nthe map and \nthe pin will move. \nNotice the GPS coordinate \nalso updates.",
        "Below the \nAdd Location button \nis the Contacts button. \nLike the Add Location button \nyou can add multiple \ncontacts.\n-- Click Add Location --",
        "When you click on \nthe Contact button it will \nadd two fields.\n\nThe Contact dropdown \nand the Add to DWR slash\nInvoice checkbox.\n-- Click Contact dropdown --",
        "The Contact dropdown \ncontains all the contacts \nwe created on the Client. \nYou can pick an existing \ncontact or create a new one.",
        "I'll pick a contact. \nThe Add to DWR slash \nInvoice checkbox will add \nthat selected contact to the\nDWR and Invoice. \nSee the creating DWRs \nand creating Invoices videos \nin this series for what \nthat looks like.",
        "Below the Add Contact button \nis the Project Shared Folder. \nMany firms use cloud storage \nor a share drive to store \nproject data. \nYou can add a link to either \nso staff can easily access \nproject data.",
        "The next required field is\nProject Manager. \nEvery job needs a \nproject manager. \nBest practice is for \nProject Managers to approve \nDWRs and sign off on \ninvoices for the jobs they’re\nresponsible for.",
        "I'll click on the dropdown \nand Select: \nLance",
        "The next field is Salesperson \nor Representative. \nJust like Project Manager \nyou can select an employee \nhere. \nIt's not a required field so I'll \nskip it.",
        "After that you have \nthe Office field. \nThis is a dropdown with all \nyour offices or departments.\n\nEvery job must be tied to an\noffice. \nIf your company has multiple \noffices, select the one this \nproject is running out of.\n\nWhen I click the dropdown \nnotice these are the offices \nwe created in the \nJob Book Setup Guide.\n\nI'll pick: \"Head Office\"",
        "The Client Project Number, \nPO Number, \nand Subcontract Number \nfields are self-explanatory, \nand I'll skip over them.",
        "The PO Amount field is the\ndollar amount the job is worth.\nThis will be displayed in the\nActive Job Dashboard. \nMore on that in later videos.",
        "After the Subcontract number \nyou'll see the required field, \nDWR Billing Type.",
        "In Job Book there are 4\ndifferent billing types:\nOverhead, \nNon-Chargeable, \nFixed Price, \nand Time & Materials",
        "An overhead job is typically\nwork done for \ninternal business operations. \n\nThink administrative tasks, \ntraining, vacation, \nand similar work.",
        "Non-chargeable jobs often\nsupport client work or projects\nbut, for various reasons, \ncannot or should not be billed \nto the client. \nExamples include \nequipment maintenance, \ninternal project work, \nrework or fixes,\nand bench time.",
        "A fixed price job, \nsometimes called a \nlump sum job, \nis a job with a set price.",
        "Finally, a time & materials, \nor T&M job, \nis a job where you bill \nthe customer based on \nthe time and materials spent \non the job.",
        "Under DWR Billing Type, \nis the Invoice Type field. \nThe options here are \nTicket slash Invoice or\nInvoice. \nMost of the time you will set \nyour job to simply be Invoice.",
        "But sometimes some of your\ncustomers might want to see \nall the hours worked on a job,\nwithout the money associated \nfor that work. \nIf that is the case set the job \nto Ticket slash Invoice. \nWe’ll talk more about this in \nthe invoicing section later in \nthe series.",
        "Next after Invoice Type we \nhave Invoice Line-Item Type. \n\nDetailed will show an \nindividual breakdown of all \nthe line items on the invoice. \nSummarized will combine \nidentical line items together \ninto one line.",
        "For example, \nsay you did a T&M job \nand you had a one-man crew\nworking: 8 hours on Monday, \n\n8 hours on Tuesday, \n\nand 4 hours on Wednesday. \n\nIf the invoice was set to \ndetailed it will have 3 lines for \neach day of work. \n\nIf the invoice was set to\nsummarized it will have \none line saying \none man crew, 20 hours.",
        "It might become clearer when \nyou watch the invoicing \nsection in this series.",
        "Next, we have \nthe GL Code Prefix. \nThis is used with \naccounting systems like Sage\nwhen companies want to \ncode jobs for import.",
        "After that is \nthe Job Categories. \nLike client types, here you \ncan tag this job with multiple \ncategories. \nDoing so will allow you to filter \njobs by their categories. \nI'll select:\nConstruction and Engineering",
        "Next there is Job Scope. \nJust like job categories these \nare more tags you can add to \nthe job.\nAs you can see we have \nmany job scopes you can tag \nthe job with. \nI'll select: \nBoundary Stake-Out \nand Commercial Building \nConstruction",
        "If there’s a scope you’d like to\nuse that isn’t on the list, \nthe Job Scope Details field \nlets you add it.",
        "Order Date and Due Date are\nfairly self explanatory. \nThe due date will be visible on \nthe Active Job Dashboard.",
        "I'll set the order date to\nSeptember 15th \nand the due date to\nOctober 31st.",
        "You can add multiple taxes to\nthe job if applicable.\n-- Click Add --\n-- Click X --",
        "And you can add \nmultiple fees as a percent \nto the job if needed.\n-- Click Add --\nAn example of a fee \nwould be a percent fee \nfor administration.\n-- Click X --",
        "Additional Fields \nwill create additional fields \non the invoice\n-- Click Add --\n-- Click X --",
        "There’s also a Notes field. \nUse this to store any internal \nnotes about the job.",
        "Next, we have the \nRate Sheet.\n\nYou'll notice the \n\"Standard Rates\" rate sheet \nwas selected by default. \nThis is because when we \ncreated the client, \nwe assigned that rate sheet \nas the default. \nSo when we created this\njob for the \"Acme\" client it\nused the default rate sheet.",
        "You can use a different rate\nsheet if you like, by simply\nclicking on the dropdown and\nselecting a different \nrate sheet to apply to the job. \nI'll pick:\n\"Construction Survey\"",
        "The \nBillable Line Items section\nconsists of a collection of \nline items. \nThese line items represent \nthe: Labour Costs,\n\n-- Click Equipment & Materials --\nEquipment & Materials,\n\n-- Click Fixed Price --\nand Fixed Price line items.\n\n-- Click Labour Costs --",
        "Pick the items your staff will\nuse on this job. \nWhen you select a line item, \nit pulls the default rate from \nthe system.\nYou can adjust rates for this\nspecific job if needed. \nYou have the option of \nmanually selecting individual \nline items to add to the job. \n\nOr you can click the blue \nReplace Line Items with\nRate Sheet button. \n\nThis will import the \nrate sheet template\nwe created in the \nHow-to Setup Job Book \nvideo series.\n-- Click \nReplace Line Items \nwith Rate Sheet --",
        "As you can see: \nLabour Costs,\n--Scroll down --\n-- Click Equipment & Materials --\nEquipment & Materials,\n\n-- Click Fixed Price --\nand Fixed Price line items.\n\n--Scroll down --",
        "Have been imported from our\n\"Construction Survey\" \nrate sheet.\n\n-- Click Labour Costs --",
        "You can still manually remove \nor add line items. \nFor example, \nfor this job it looks like there \nare two field staff \navailable to work. \nLet's change that. \nLet's remove the \n\"Survey Assist\" \nand \"Party Chief\". \n\nYou can do that\nby clicking on the X to the left\nof the line item.\n-- Click X --\n-- Click X --",
        "Now they are removed \nbut we don't have any \nfield staff line items that \npeople can select and use. \n\nLet's add a new line item.\nClick the Add button.\n-- Click Add --",
        "Notice everything is blank.\nClick on \nthe Cost Item dropdown\nand select: \n\"1 Man Survey Crew\"",
        "This is the order \nthe line items are in. \nIf you want to change \nthe order, \nsimply click on the arrows to \nmove the line items.\n\nI'm going to move the \n\"1 Man Survey Crew\" \nto the top.",
        "Let's take a look at \nthe Fixed Price tab.\n-- Click Fixed Price --\n\nThere are a lot of line items\nhere we don't need. \nI'm going to remove \nall of them besides\n\"Construction Survey\"",
        "Ok that looks good. \nLet's go back to \nthe Labour Costs tab.\n-- Click Labour Costs --",
        "Let's take a closer look at \nthe individual line items. \nNotice the \"Unit Cost\" for \nthe \"1 Man Survey Crew\" was \nautomatically set. \n\nThis number came from the\ndefault rate that we set in the\nHow-to Setup \nJob Book video series.",
        "Let's change that to: \"$160\"",
        "The CAD, \nProject Manager, and \nProfessional Land Surveyor \n\"Unit Cost\" was taken from \nthe \"Construction Survey\" \nrate sheet. \nYou can also override those \nunit costs but I won't bother.",
        "At this point, you might be\nwondering about the empty\n\"Budget Quantity\" fields.",
        "The budget quantity fields are\nused when estimating \nthe amount of time \nor quantity a line item will \ntake for a given job. \nEvery job, whether fixed price \nor T&M, should have an\nestimate associated with it. \n\nBest practice is to fill in the\nbudget quantity for each\nindividual line item based on\nthe estimate. \n\nWe cover budget quantity in \nmore depth in our Job Book \nReporting Guide series.",
        "For now, I'm going to fill in\nthe budget quantity for all the\nline items.",
        "Now that this is done, I'm \ngoing to save the job. \nDon't worry if you need to \nmake any changes to the job, \nyou can always go back \nand edit the job later.\n-- Click Save --",
        "Once the job is saved, \nyou'll see the Jobs Item List. \nIt defaults to \nthe Active jobs tab.\n\nThe Inactive and the All tabs\nwill show you the inactive jobs\nand all the jobs in \nthe system respectively.",
        "To edit a specific job, \nsimply click the job.\n-- Click Job --",
        "From the job display screen \nyou can edit, \nexport to PDF, \nclose,\ndelete, \nor return to the job list. \n\nWe’ll cover cloning and\ndeleting jobs later.",
        "To Edit the job, \nclick the Edit button\n-- Click Edit --",
        "You can go ahead and edit \nany field you like. \nIncluding the Job Number.",
        "At the bottom of the job there\nis an Active checkbox.",
        "Once a job is completed and\ninvoiced the best practice is \nto deactivate the job in the\nsystem. \n\nA deactivated job can’t be \nselected when creating DWRs.\n\nYou can always reactivate \na job if it becomes active \nagain or if you need to assign \ntime to it.",
        "All jobs are still visible in\nthe All tab and still visible in\nthe Job Maps.",
        "Because the system does not\nallow referenced data to be\ndeleted, \nbest practice is to\ndeactivate Jobs \ninstead of deleting them.",
        "Once all your edits are \ncomplete remember to click \nthe Save button.\n-- Click Save --",
        "This will take you back to the\nJob Display screen.",
        "If you click the Clone button,\nit will create a copy of the\njob. \n\nA new Job Number will be\nassigned. \n\nhe Status of the job, \nthe PO #, and PO Amount \nwill not be set. \n\nAll the other data will \nbe copied.",
        "Cloning a job is useful when a\nproject has parts that need to\nbe invoiced separately,\n \nfor example, projects with \nmultiple phases or different \nscopes.",
        "I'm going to go ahead \nand create a few more jobs \nin the system.\n\nFeel free to pause the video \nand create your own jobs.",
        "We’ll use these jobs \nthroughout the rest of \nthe How to Use \nJob Book series \nand in future training videos.",
        "-----",
        "So why are jobs important? \n\nEvery DWR, expense, \nand invoice must be tied to \na job. \n\nJobs give you real-time \nvisibility on project progress. \n\nReports and backlogs \nare organized by job.",
        "For information on \nJob Reports,\nsee our Job Book \nReporting Guide series.",
        "Or click on the link below in\nthe description to learn more.",
        "That’s everything you need to\nknow to start creating and\nmanaging jobs in Job Book.",
        "In the next video, I’ll show you\nhow to create \nDaily Work Records, \nor DWRs, which your staff will \nuse to record time \nand materials.",
        "After that, we’ll cover \ncreating Expenses.",
