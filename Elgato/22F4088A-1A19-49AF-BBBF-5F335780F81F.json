        "Welcome back to the Job Book How\nto Use Series.",
        "This series is for staff who are\nworking with Job Book daily.",
        "If you’re joining mid-series,\nstart at the beginning since\neach video builds on the one\nbefore it.",
        "In the last section, I showed\nyou how to create clients in Job\nBook. In this video, I’ll show\nyou how to create jobs in Job\nBook.",
        "Every project your company works\non should be created as a job in\nJob Book. Jobs tie together\nclients, offices, project\nmanagers, and line items.",
        "Let’s walk through creating a\njob.",
        "As you may remember from the\nDashboard Overview video, only\nAdministrators or Job\nCoordinators can create jobs. So\nI'll log in with the\nAdministrator role.",
        "From the dashboard, click the\nCreate New button inside the\nJobs Card second from the top\nleft.\n-- Click Create New --",
        "The first field is Job Number.\nThis is required. Job Book will\nautomatically generate a number\nfor you, but you can overwrite\nit with your own company’s\nnumbering system if you prefer.",
        "Next to the Job Number is the\nJob Number Counter. You can\nchange the counter by unlocking\nthe blue lock button with a\nclick. This unlocks the Job\nNumber Counter so you can set\nit. I'll set this to: \"250001\"\nWhen you click the blue lock\nbutton it will lock in the\ncounter.",
        "Notice the Job Number now\ndefaults to the Job Number\nCounter.",
        "Next is the Client field. Here\nyou can either create a new\nclient or pick one from the\ndropdown list of clients you’ve\nalready created. Let’s choose\n“Acme Corporation” from the\nlist.",
        "For Client Location you have the\noption of either using the\ndropdown and selecting a\nlocation you previously made for\nthe client, or filling in the\nClient Address at the time of\njob creation. I'll use the\ndropdown and select: \"Head\nOffice\"",
        "Notice the Client Address is\nauto-populated with the address\nwe set when we created the\nclient in the previous video.\nHowever, you can manually edit\nand override the address.",
        "Next is the Project Name. Let’s\nenter the name of our job:\n“Boundary Survey 5th Avenue”",
        "After that is the Status. This\ndropdown is required. Setting\nthe status and updating the\nstatus of the job frequently is\nconsidered best practice. That\nway staff know exactly where\njobs are in the workflow. I'll\nselect: \"Job Setup\" from the\nlist.",
        "The Add Location button is where\nyou set the job location. You\ncan add multiple locations to a\njob if needed. For this example,\nI'll just be adding one\nlocation.",
        "-- Click Add Location --\nClicking the Add Location button\nwill add a location to a job.\nHere we can see: Location Name,\nthis is just a site name.\nMunicipal Address, this is the\naddress the system will try to\nfind on a map. More on that\nlater. State or Province And\nCity.",
        "The Legal Addresses button\nallows you to include data such\nas Lot, Block, Plan, and\nSection, Township, Range, if\nneeded.",
        "I'll go ahead and fill in a\nlocation name and municipal\naddress for this job.\n-- PAUSE --",
        "As you can see, I've filled in\nall the fields. You'll notice\nthe GPS Coordinates are blank.\nIf I click on the Map Display\ndropdown the system will try to\nfind the municipal address.\n-- CLICK Map Display --",
        "As you can see the system found\nthe address and placed a blue\npin on the mark. If you want to\nmove the pin, simply left click\nanywhere on the map and the pin\nwill move. Notice the GPS\ncoordinate also updates.",
        "Below the Add Location button is\nthe Contacts button. Like the\nAdd Location button you can add\nmultiple contacts.\n-- Click Add Location --",
        "When you click on the Contact\nbutton it will add two fields.\nThe Contact dropdown and the Add\nto DWR slash Invoice checkbox.\n-- Click Contact dropdown --",
        "The Contact dropdown contains\nall the contacts we created on\nthe Client. You can pick an\nexisting contact or create a new\none.",
        "I'll pick a contact. The Add to\nDWR slash Invoice checkbox will\nadd that selected contact to the\nDWR and Invoice. See the\ncreating DWRs and creating\nInvoices videos in this series\nfor what that looks like.",
        "Below the Add Contact button is\nthe Project Shared Folder. Many\nfirms use cloud storage or a\nshare drive to store project\ndata. You can add a link to\neither so staff can easily\naccess project data.",
        "The next required field is\nProject Manager. Every job needs\na project manager. Best practice\nis for Project Managers to\napprove DWRs and sign off on\ninvoices for the jobs they’re\nresponsible for.",
        "I'll click on the dropdown and\nSelect: Lance",
        "The next field is Salesperson or\nRepresentative. Just like\nProject Manager you can select\nan employee here. It's not a\nrequired field so I'll skip it.",
        "After that you have the Office\nfield. This is a dropdown with\nall your offices or departments.\nEvery job must be tied to an\noffice. If your company has\nmultiple offices, select the one\nthis project is running out of.\nWhen I click the dropdown notice\nthese are the offices we created\nin the Job Book Setup Guide.\nI'll pick: \"Head Office\"",
        "The Client Project Number, PO\nNumber, and Subcontract Number\nfields are self-explanatory, and\nI'll skip over them.",
        "The PO Amount field is the\ndollar amount the job is worth.\nThis will be displayed in the\nActive Job Dashboard. More on\nthat in later videos.",
        "After the Subcontract # you'll\nsee the required field, DWR\nBilling Type.",
        "In Job Book there are 4\ndifferent billing types:\nOverhead, Non-Chargeable, Fixed\nPrice, and Time & Materials",
        "An overhead job is typically\nwork done for internal business\noperations. Think administrative\ntasks, training, vacation, and\nsimilar work.",
        "Non-chargeable jobs often\nsupport client work or projects\nbut, for various reasons, cannot\nor should not be billed to the\nclient. Examples include\nequipment maintenance, internal\nproject work, rework or fixes,\nand bench time.",
        "A fixed price job, sometimes\ncalled a lump sum job, is a job\nwith a set price.",
        "Finally, a time & materials, or\nT&M job, is a job where you bill\nthe customer based on the time\nand materials spent on the job.",
        "Under DWR Billing Type, is the\nInvoice Type field. The options\nhere are Ticket slash Invoice or\nInvoice. Most of the time you\nwill set your job to simply be\nInvoice.",
        "But sometimes some of your\ncustomers might want to see all\nthe hours worked on a job,\nwithout the money associated for\nthat work. If that is the case\nset the job to Ticket slash\nInvoice. We’ll talk more about\nthis in the invoicing section\nlater in the series.",
        "Next after Invoice Type we have\nInvoice Line-Item Type. Detailed\nwill show an individual\nbreakdown of all the line items\non the invoice. Summarized will\ncombine identical line items\ntogether into one line.",
        "For example, say you did a T&M\njob and you had a one-man crew\nworking: 8 hours on Monday, 8\nhours on Tuesday, and 4 hours on\nWednesday. If the invoice was\nset to detailed it will have 3\nlines for each day of work. If\nthe invoice was set to\nsummarized it will have one line\nsaying one man crew, 20 hours.",
        "It might become clearer when you\nwatch the invoicing section in\nthis series.",
        "Next, we have the GL Code\nPrefix. This is used with\naccounting systems like Sage\nwhen companies want to code jobs\nfor import.",
        "After that is the Job\nCategories. Like client types,\nhere you can tag this job with\nmultiple categories. Doing so\nwill allow you to filter jobs by\ntheir categories. I'll select:\nConstruction and Engineering",
        "Next there is Job Scope. Just\nlike job categories these are\nmore tags you can add to the\njob. As you can see we have many\njob scopes you can tag the job\nwith. I'll select: Boundary\nStake-Out and Commercial\nBuilding Construction",
        "If there’s a scope you’d like to\nuse that isn’t on the list, the\nJob Scope Details field lets you\nadd it.",
        "Order Date and Due Date are\nfairly self explanatory. The due\ndate will be visible on the\nActive Job Dashboard.",
        "I'll set the order date\nSeptember 15th and the due date\nOctober 31st.",
        "You can add multiple taxes to\nthe job if applicable.\n-- Click Add --\n-- Click X --",
        "And you can add multiple fees as\na percent to the job if needed.\n-- Click Add --\nAn example of a fee would be a\npercent fee for administration.\n-- Click X --",
        "Additional Fields will create\nadditional fields on the invoice\n-- Click Add --\n-- Click X --",
        "There’s also a Notes field. Use\nthis to store any internal notes\nabout the job.",
        "Next, we have the Rate Sheet.\nYou'll notice the \"Standard\nRates\" rate sheet was selected\nby default. This is because when\nwe created the client, we\nassigned that rate sheet as the\ndefault. So when we created this\njob for the \"Acme\" client it\nused the default rate sheet.",
        "You can use a different rate\nsheet if you like, by simply\nclicking on the dropdown and\nselecting a different rate sheet\nto apply to the job. I'll pick:\n\"Construction Survey\"",
        "The Billable Line Items section\nconsists of a collection of line\nitems. These line items\nrepresent the: Labour Costs,\n-- Click Equipment & Materials --\nEquipment & Materials,\n-- Click Fixed Price --\nand Fixed Price line items.\n-- Click Labour Costs --",
        "Pick the items your staff will\nuse on this job. When you select\na line item, it pulls the\ndefault rate from the system.\nYou can adjust rates for this\nspecific job if needed. You have\nthe option of manually selecting\nindividual line items to add to\nthe job. Or you can click the\nblue Replace Line Items with\nRate Sheet button. This will\nimport the rate sheet template\nwe created in the How-to Setup\nJob Book video series.\n-- Click Replace Line Items with Rate Sheet --",
        "As you can see: Labour Costs,\n--Scroll down --\n-- Click Equipment & Materials --\nEquipment & Materials,\n-- Click Fixed Price --\nand Fixed Price line items.\n--Scroll down --",
        "Have been imported from our\n\"Construction Survey\" rate\nsheet.\n-- Click Labour Costs --",
        "You can still manually remove or\nadd line items. For example, for\nthis job it looks like there are\ntwo field staff available to\nwork. Let's change that. Let's\nremove the \"Survey Assist\" and\n\"Party Chief\". You can do that\nby clicking on the X to the left\nof the line item.\n-- Click X --\n-- Click X --",
        "Now they are removed but we\ndon't have any field staff line\nitems that people can select and\nuse. Let's add a new line item.\nClick the Add button.\n-- Click Add --",
        "Notice everything is blank.\nClick on the Cost Item dropdown\nand select: \"1 Man Survey Crew\"",
        "This is the order the line items\nare in. If you want to change\nthe order, simply click on the\narrows to move the line items.\nI'm going to move the \"1 Man\nSurvey Crew\" to the top.",
        "Let's take a look at the Fixed\nPrice tab.\n-- Click Fixed Price --\nThere are a lot of line items\nhere we don't need. I'm going to\nremove all of them besides\n\"Construction Survey\"",
        "Ok that looks good. Let's go\nback to the Labour Costs tab.\n-- Click Labour Costs --",
        "Let's take a closer look at the\nindividual line items. Notice\nthe \"Unit Cost\" for the \"1 Man\nSurvey Crew\" was automatically\nset. This number came from the\ndefault rate that we set in the\nHow-to Setup Job Book video\nseries.",
        "Let's change that to: \"$160\"",
        "The CAD, Project Manager, and\nProfessional Land Surveyor \"Unit\nCost\" was taken from the\n\"Construction Survey\" rate\nsheet. You can also override\nthose unit costs but I won't\nbother.",
        "At this point, you might be\nwondering about the empty\n\"Budget Quantity\" fields.",
        "The budget quantity fields are\nused when estimating the amount\nof time or quantity a line item\nwill take for a given job. Every\njob, whether fixed price or T&M,\nshould have an estimate\nassociated with it. Best\npractice is to fill in the\nbudget quantity for each\nindividual line item based on\nthe estimate. We cover budget\nquantity in more depth in our\nJob Book Reporting Guide series.",
        "For now, I'm going to fill in\nthe budget quantity for all the\nline items.",
        "Now that this is done, I'm going\nto save the job. Don't worry if\nyou need to make any changes to\nthe job, you can always go back\nand edit the job.\n-- Click Save --",
        "Once the job is saved, you'll\nsee the Jobs Item List. It\ndefaults to the Active jobs tab.\nThe Inactive and the All tabs\nwill show you the inactive jobs\nand all the jobs in the system\nrespectively.",
        "To edit a specific job, simply\nclick the job.\n-- Click Job --",
        "From the job display screen you\ncan edit, export to PDF, close,\ndelete, or return to the job\nlist. We’ll cover cloning and\ndeleting jobs later.",
        "To Edit the job, click the Edit\nbutton\n-- Click Edit --",
        "You can go ahead and edit any\nfield you like. Including the\nJob Number.",
        "At the bottom of the job there\nis an Active checkbox.",
        "Once a job is completed and\ninvoiced the best practice is to\ndeactivate the job in the\nsystem. A deactivated job can’t\nbe selected when creating DWRs.\nYou can always reactivate a job\nif it becomes active again or if\nyou need to assign time to it.",
        "All jobs are still visible in\nthe All tab and still visible in\nthe Job Maps.",
        "Because the system does not\nallow referenced data to be\ndeleted best practice is to\ndeactivate Jobs instead of\ndeleting them.",
        "Once all your edits are complete\nremember to click the Save\nbutton.\n-- Click Save --",
        "This will take you back to the\nJob Display screen.",
        "If you click the Clone button,\nit will create a copy of the\njob. A new Job Number will be\nassigned. The Status of the job,\nthe PO #, and PO Amount will not\nbe set. All the other data will\nbe copied.",
        "Cloning a job is useful when a\nproject has parts that need to\nbe invoiced separately, for\nexample, projects with multiple\nphases or different scopes.",
        "I'm going to go ahead and create\na few more jobs in the system.\nFeel free to pause the video and\ncreate your own jobs.",
        "We’ll use these jobs throughout\nthe rest of the How to Use Job\nBook series and in future\ntraining videos.",
        "-- --",
        "So why are jobs important? Every\nDWR, expense, and invoice must\nbe tied to a job. Jobs give you\nreal-time visibility on project\nprogress. Reports and backlogs\nare organized by job.",
        "For information on Job Reports,\nsee our Job Book Reporting Guide\nseries.",
        "Or click on the link below in\nthe description to learn more.",
        "That’s everything you need to\nknow to start creating and\nmanaging jobs in Job Book.",
        "In the next video, I’ll show you\nhow to create Daily Work\nRecords, or DWRs, which your\nstaff will use to record time\nand materials.",
        "After that, we’ll cover creating\nExpenses.",
        "Thanks for watching! and I'll\nsee you in the next video!"
