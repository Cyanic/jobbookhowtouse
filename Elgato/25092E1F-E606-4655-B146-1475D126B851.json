        "\n\n\nWelcome back to the \nJob Book How to Use Series.\n\nThis series is for staff who are \nworking with Job Book daily.\n\nIf you’re joining mid-series, \nstart at the beginning since \neach video builds on the \none before it.",
        "In the last section, \nI showed you the dashboard. \nIn this video, \nI’ll show you how to \ncreate clients in Job Book.",
        "Before you can create jobs \nin Job Book, \nyou first need to set up \na client. \nEvery job in Job Book \nmust be tied to a client \nrecord.",
        "Let’s go ahead and create a \nclient in the system.",
        "-----",
        "I'm now logged into \nthe system as an \nAdministrator role.",
        "As you may remember from \nthe Dashboard Overview \nvideo, only a person with \nthe role of Administror \nor Job Coordinator \nis able to create a client.",
        "From the dashboard, \nclick the Create New button \ninside the Clients Card \nat the top left.\n-- Click Create New --",
        "The first tab is the client tab \nand the first field is \nClient Name. \n\nAs you may remember from \nthe Job Book Setup Series, \nany field with a red star is \nrequired.\n\nThe Client Name is usually \nthe company name. \nFor residential work, \nuse the homeowner’s name.",
        "Let’s enter the client name: \n“Springfield Engineering Ltd.”",
        "The rest of the fields in \nthe Client tab are not required \nto make a client but \nlet's go through them anyhow.",
        "Next is Website. \nLet's enter: \n\"www.springfield.com\"",
        "Then Client Types. \nHere you can tag \nthis customer with multiple \npremade types. \nDoing so will allow you to \nfilter clients by type.\nI'll select: \nConstruction and Engineers",
        "After that, Rate Sheet. \nYou can set a default \nRate Sheet to this customer \nsuch that whenever you \ncreate a job for this customer \nit will default to this rate sheet. \nAssuming you've watched \nthe Job Book Setup Series \nand have setup some \nrate sheets in your system \nyou should be able to select \na Rate Sheet to apply to \nthis customer. \nIn my case I'll pick: \n\"Standard Rates\"",
        "Next is Payment Terms. \nYou can choose a \npreset option or \ntype in custom terms. \nPayment terms are for \nreference only and don’t \naffect system behavior.\n\nI'll select: \n\"Account - 30\" \nThat way I’ll know to follow up \nif the customer hasn’t paid \nwithin 30 days.",
        "Then the Notes field. \nYou can type multiple lines \nhere as notes on the customer.\n\nI'll leave this blank for now.",
        "There is an \nAttachments button where \nyou can upload files \npertaining to the customer. \n\nI'll leave this blank for now.",
        "Let's move to \nthe Contacts tab. \n-- Click Contacts tab --",
        "Here you can add as many \ncontacts to the client \nas you like. \n-- Click Add --",
        "You’ll see that First Name \nand Last Name are required. \nThe other fields are optional.\nI'll go ahead and fill this out.",
        "If this client has more than \none contact simply add more \nby clicking on the Add button \non the bottom.\n-- Click Add --",
        "I'll go ahead and fill \nthe second contact out also.",
        "Once you've filled out \nthe contacts scroll up \nand click on \nthe Addresses tab.\n-- Click Addresses --",
        "Here you can \nadd billing addresses \nfor invoices. \n\nThese are not \njob site addresses.\n\nClick the Add button to \nadd an address to this client.\n-- Click Add --",
        "The first field is \nthe Location Name \nand is required. \nThe rest are not. \nI'll go ahead and fill this out.",
        "If your customer has \nmultiple offices \nor mailing addresses \nyou would add them here. \nI'll go ahead and add \nanother location to this client.",
        "Once you have that \ncompleted scroll down to \nthe Save button \nand click save.\n-- Click Save --",
        "If you missed a required field \nthe system will highlight it \nin red. If you don't see the \nred field check the other tabs.",
        "Once all the required fields \nare set you should be able to \nsave the client and you will \ngo back to the dashboard.",
        "Don't worry, \nif you made any mistakes \ncreating the client you \ncan always edit them.",
        "To edit a client, \nfrom the dashboard, \nclick the Explore button \ninside the Clients Card \nat the top left.\n-- Click Explore --",
        "You'll see the Client Item List. \nIt defaults to \nthe Active clients tab.\nIf you want to see all \nyour clients you can click \non the All tab. \nThis will show you all \nthe active and inactive clients \nin the system.",
        "To edit a specific client, \nsimply click the client.\n-- Click Client --",
        "From the client display screen \nyou can edit, \nexport to PDF, \ndelete, \nor return to the client list.\nSince referenced clients \ncan’t be deleted, \nthe best practice is \nto deactivate them instead.\nMore on that later.",
        "To Edit the client click \nthe Edit button\n-- Click Edit --",
        "Notice this client now has \nboth a System Client Number \nand a Client Number Alias.",
        "The Client Number Alias \ncan be edited to any unique \ntext you like.",
        "You can go ahead and edit \nany field you like.",
        "At the bottom of the client \nthere is an Active checkbox.",
        "Because the system does \nnot allow referenced data \nto be deleted best practice is \nto deactivate Clients instead \nof deleting them.",
        "Once all your edits are \ncomplete remember to click \nthe Save button.\n-- Click Save --",
        "This will take you back to \nthe Client Item List.",
        "I'm going to go ahead \nand create a few more clients \nin the system.\nFeel free to pause the video \nand create your own clients.",
        "We’ll use these clients \nthroughout the rest of the \nHow to Use Job Book series \nand in future training videos.",
        "-----",
        "So how are Clients used \nin the system?",
        "Like we said every job \nin Job Book must be tied to \na client record.",
