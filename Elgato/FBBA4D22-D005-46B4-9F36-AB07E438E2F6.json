        "Welcome back to the Job Book How\nto Use Series. If this is your\nfirst time watching, remember\nthat each episode builds on the\nlast.",
        "In the previous video, we\ncleared the Expense Approval\nBacklog so reimbursements and\njob costs stayed accurate. Those\napproved expenses now wait\nalongside labour in the billing\npipeline.",
        "Today, we’ll focus on invoicing\nthe client. In Job Book, there\nare two types of invoices. Fixed\nprice invoices, where the client\nis charged a fixed amount for\nthe service. And\ntime-and-materials invoices,\nwhere the client is charged\nbased on the actual time spent\nand materials used during the\nproject.",
        "Time-and-materials invoices are\nlabour intensive to create\nbecause they require careful\ntracking of all hours worked and\nmaterials used during the\nproject. Missing Daily Work\nRecords on an invoice means lost\nrevenue and delays cash flow.",
        "Thankfully, Job Book simplifies\nthe invoicing process by\nautomatically collecting all\napproved DWRs for jobs set to\nTime and Materials. So it's easy\nto generate draft Invoices for\nfinal approval from a Project\nManager. To do this we will use\nthe DWR Invoice Backlog. And in\nthis video we will focus on the\nDWR Invoice Backlog. Getting\nthis step right keeps billing\naccurate, clients confident, and\ncash flow predictable.",
        "Why does the DWR Invoice Backlog\nmatter? Every approved DWR\nrepresents work your team has\nalready delivered. Until you\nconvert that work into an\ninvoice, revenue sits in limbo.\nThis backlog is the last review\nbefore totals, rates, and\ndescriptions reach a client.\nSkipping it risks underbilling,\ndouble billing, or sending the\nwrong detail trail to\naccounting.",
        "I’m logged in as an\nAdministrator. Typically, an\nAdministrator converts DWRs for\nTime and Material jobs into\ndraft invoices for Project\nManagers to review and approve.",
        "From the main dashboard, look at\nthe Workflow card in the middle\nof the second row. This is where\nbilling queues live for\nadministrators.",
        "-- Click DWR Invoice Backlog --\nThe DWR Invoice Backlog is the\ntime-and-materials invoice\ncreation center for Job Book.",
        "The grid lists every approved\nDWR that belongs to a\ntime-and-material job that has\nnot yet been invoiced.",
        "If you've watched our DWR\nApproval Backlog video earlier\nin this series. All of this will\nlook very familiar, and it\nbehaves almost exactly the same.",
        "At the top left, you’ll see the\nInvoice Selected DWRs button. It\nwill stay inactive until we have\nat least one DWR checked. At the\ntop right, you’ll see the Expand\nAll, Collapse All buttons",
        "Below that is the grouping bar.\nYou can drag column headers here\nto group jobs by Job Number,\nProject Manager, or other\nfields.",
        "Below that is the DWR Table,\nwhich shows all DWRs in the\nsystem that have not yet been\ninvoiced.",
        "The first column is a checkbox.\nClicking the checkbox in the\nheader selects all DWRs for bulk\ninvoice generation. Unchecking\nit clears all selections.",
        "Next are the Date, Created By,\nand DWR Number columns. The DWR\nNumber column contains\nhyperlinks to the individual\nDWRs.",
        "Then you have the Job Number,\nClient, Project Manager, and\nOffice columns.",
        "Sorting and filtering is done\njust like the DWR Approval\nBacklog. Watch the DWR Approval\nBacklog video earlier in this\nseries if you want to learn more\nabout how sorting and filtering\nworks.",
        "Just like the DWR Approval\nBacklog there is the familiar\nblue triangle on the left side\nof the table. Clicking it,\nexpands the DWR to show more\ndetails.",
        "The Expand All and Collapse All\nwork just like the DWR Approval\nBacklog.",
        "After you’ve reviewed the DWRs,\ncheck the boxes for the DWRs you\nwant to generate an invoice for.\nThe Invoice Selected DWRs button\nwill become active.",
        "To generate an invoice, click\nthe Invoice Selected DWRs\nbutton. If you select DWRs for\nmultiple different jobs, each\nunique job will generate its own\ninvoice.\n-- Click Invoice Selected DWRs --",
        "You’ll see a confirmation pop-up\nshowing the number of DWRs\nyou’re about to turn into an\ninvoice. Click OK.\n-- Click OK --",
        "The selected DWRs have now\ngererated an Invoice. You’ll\nnotice the DWRs disappear from\nthe backlog immediately.",
        "You’ll also see a green popup\nshowing the invoice number and\nwhich job it was created for.\nThere is a button you can click\non that will take you right to\nthe generated Invoice. If you\nclick the button a new tab will\nopen to the Invoice created.\n-- Click here to access new Invoice --",
        "If you made a mistake while\ngenerating the invoice, don’t\nworry. If you delete an invoice\ngenerated from the DWR Invoice\nBacklog, the DWRs used to create\nthat invoice will return to the\nbacklog for review.",
        "Let me show you.\n-- Click Delete --\n-- Click Delete --\nThis will take you to the Job\nBook Dashboard, so I'll go back\nto the DWR Invoice Backlog.\n-- Click DWR Invoice Backlog --",
        "As you can see the DWRs we used\nto create the Invoice that we\njust deleted are now back in the\nDWR Invoice Backlog.",
        "When you generate an invoice\nusing the DWR Invoice Backlog,\nall invoices go to the Invoices\ncard and enter the PM Queue for\nProject Manager review.",
        "We will do a deep dive on the\nInvoice process in the next\nvideo.",
        "For now, let's connect the dots.\nField teams create DWRs. Project\nmanagers approve them in their\nrespective backlogs.\nAdministrators convert approved\nDWRs into invoices here. Project\nmanagers sign the drafts,\nadministrators deliver them, and\nthe Active Job Dashboard stays\ncurrent the entire time.",
        "A few best practices make the\nDWR Invoice Backlog run\nsmoothly:",
        "Schedule a dedicated billing\nblock every week. When the queue\nnever grows stale, clients see\ntimely invoices and cash flow\nstabilizes.",
        "Use the grouping bar or filter\nto process one client at a time\nduring month end. Sending a\nunified package per client\nreduces back-and-forth\nquestions.",
        "After each billing session,\nrefresh the grid and\ndouble-check that you haven’t\nmissed anything. Anything still\nin the backlog should have a\nclear plan to move forward.",
        "Before we wrap up, here’s a\nquick recap. We opened the DWR\nInvoice Backlog and reviewed the\nsupporting DWR data. We\nconverted selected DWRs into\ninvoices ready for Project\nManagers to review in the PM\nQueue. Each step keeps the path\nfrom field work to revenue clear\nand controlled.",
        "In the next episode, we’ll stay\nin the invoicing workflow and\nbuild invoices from scratch.\nYou’ll see how to handle\nfixed-price jobs, edit draft\ndocuments, and tailor invoice\nformats before sending them to\nclients.",
        "Thanks for watching, and I'll\nsee you in the next video!",
