        "In this video, I’ll show you how\nto create Daily Work Records, or\nDWRs, in Job Book.",
        "Technicians create most DWRs\neach day. So I’m logged in as a\nTechnician, simulating being on\na cell phone. Project managers\nand administrators can follow\nthe same steps.",
        "DWRs are the backbone of Job\nBook. They replace paper\ntimesheets, keep labour,\nequipment, and materials tied to\nthe correct job, and feed the\napproval, invoicing, and\nreporting workflows you’ll see\nlater in this series.",
        "From the dashboard, look for the\nDaily Work Records card.",

        "Click the Cost Item dropdown.\n-- Click Cost Item dropdown --",
        "This section pulls line items\nfrom the job, so what you’re\nseeing here is based on the\nsetup we did earlier, when we\ncreated the job. Different jobs\nwill have different line items\nto pick from.",
        "Choose the labour line item that\nmatches the work performed. I’ll\nselect “1 Man Survey Crew.”",
        "Now select the Employee that did\nthe work.\n-- Click Employee dropdown --\nA crew lead can add time for the\nrest of the crew as well. We’ll\nadd additional labour in just a\nmoment.",
        "Enter Hours Worked. Today we\nwere on site for 8 hours. You\ncan either select a start time\nand end time, or simply enter\nthe total hours worked.",

The description\nhelps with record keeping and\nDWR approvals so make sure you\nadd enough details.\n-- Type \"Set control points along south property line. Heavy rain delayed layout after 1 PM.\" --\nA detailed note helps the\nproject manager understand the\nday at a glance without calling\nyou for more context.",
        "If you need to break the shift\ninto multiple activities or need\nto add another crew member, add\nanother labour line item. When a\ncrew lead enters time for\nothers, make sure the hours\nmatch what they worked.",
        "I'll go ahead and add another\ncrew member.\n-- Click Add --",
        "Notice all the familiar fields.",
        "I'll select “1 Man Survey Crew”\nagain. For the employee I'll use\n\"Denice Rodman\"",
        "Denice worked the same hours as\nme so this time I'll just input\n8 hours, instead of using a\nstart and end time.",

        "Notice for Equipment and\nMaterials, the Description is\nnot a required field.",
        "Below DWR Details is the\nRepresentative Signature.\nBecause someone can create DWRs\nfor other employees, the person\ncreating the record needs to\nsign off on it. Assuming you've\nsaved your signature as an\nemployee, clicking the \"Add My\nSignature\" button will\nautomatically add your signature\nand fill in the Representative\nfield.",
        "The Client’s Representative\nSignature is optional, used when\ntechnicians need to get a\nclient’s signature on a DWR.",
        "If you’re still working in the\nfield and plan to come back\nlater to add information,\nuncheck the Submitted box. DWRs\nthat have not been submitted\nwill be in your My Form Not\nSubmitted tab. More on that\nlater in the video.",
        "I'll uncheck the Submitted\ncheckbox to show you.",
        "Now let’s save the record.",

        "At the top you’ll see three\ntabs: My Forms Not Submitted, My\nForms Not Approved, and All My\nForms.",
        "My Forms Not Submitted, as the\nname suggests, shows the DWRs\nyou’ve created but not yet\nsubmitted for approval. Here you\ncan see the DWR we just created.",
        "-- Click My Forms Not Approved --\nThis is the My Forms Not\nApproved tab. Notice there are\nno DWRs here.",
        "DWRs located in the My Forms Not\nSubmitted or My Forms Not\nApproved tabs can be edited.\nOnce the DWR has been approved,\nit can no longer be edited by a\ntechnician. If you need to edit\na DWR that has been approved,\nyou’ll need to ask a Project\nManager or Administrator to\nuncheck the Submitted box so you\ncan edit it again.",
        "-- Click All My Forms --\nThe All My Forms tab will show\nall your DWRs. Once a DWR has\nbeen approved you will only be\nable to see it in this tab. You\ncan not edit DWRs in this tab.",
        "Let's go ahead and submit the\nDWR we just created. To do that\nclick on My Forms Not Submitted.\n-- Click My Forms Not Submitted --\nThen click on the DWR.",
        "There are four buttons on the\ntop of the Display screen. Edit,\nExport to PDF, Delete, and Back.",
        "The Edit button will allow you\nto edit the DWR. The Export to\nPDF button creates a file you\ncan print or email to a customer\nif needed. The Delete button\nwill delete the DWR and the Back\nbutton will take you back to the\ndisplay screen.",
        "For now click the Edit button so\nwe can submit the DWR.\n-- Click Edit --",
        "Here you can edit whatever\ninformation you like. When\neverything is complete and\naccurate, check the Submitted\nbox and save. This will add the\nDWR to the approval backlog for\nyour project manager.",
        "Notice the Submitted Date is\nautomatically saved.",
        "-- Click Save --\nOnce saved click the Back button\n-- Click Back --",
        "You'll notice on the Explore\nlist your DWR is gone. That's\nbecause you are in the My Form\nNot Submitted tab. If you click\non the My Form Not Approved tab\n-- Click My Forms Not Approved --\nYou should see your DWR waiting\nto be approved by a project\nmanager.",
        "That’s about everything you need\nto know to create Daily Work\nRecords in Job Book.",
        "If you are a project manager you\nmight be interested in how to\napprove all these DWRs. If so\ncheck out our DWR Approval\nBacklog video. We’ll step\nthrough that approval process\nfrom the manager’s point of\nview.",
        "If you are an administrator you\nmight be interested in how to\nturn all these DWRs into\ninvoices. If so check out our\nDWR Invoice Backlog video. We’ll\nstep through that inovice\ncreation from the\nadministrator's point of view.",
        "Before we wrap up, here are a\nfew best practices: Submit DWRs\nevery day. Waiting until the end\nof the week increases the risk\nof missing hours or losing track\nof equipment. Double-check the\njob and date before submitting.\nReassigning DWRs after approval\ntakes time away from billing the\njob.",
        "By following these steps, every\nDWR becomes a reliable record\nthat supports approvals,\ndashboards, and invoices without\nextra work.",
        "In the next video, we’ll stay in\nthe technician role and walk\nthrough creating expenses.",
        "Thanks for watching, and I’ll\nsee you in the next video!"
