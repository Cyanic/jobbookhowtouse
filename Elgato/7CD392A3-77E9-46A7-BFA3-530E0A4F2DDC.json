        "In this video, I'll show\nyou how to create Daily\nWork Records, or DWRs,\nin Job Book.",
        "Technicians create most\nDWRs each day.\n\nSo I'm logged in as a\nTechnician, simulating\nbeing on a cell phone.\n\nProject managers and\nadministrators can\nfollow the same steps.",
        "DWRs are the backbone of\nJob Book.\n\nThey replace paper\ntimesheets, keep labour,\nequipment, and materials\ntied to the correct job,\nand feed the approval,\ninvoicing, and reporting\nworkflows you'll see\nlater in this series.",
        "From the dashboard, look\nfor the Daily Work\nRecords card.",

        "Date is the first field\nand defaults to today's\ndate.\n\nThe date should be set\nto when the work\nhappened.\n\nIf you're logging\nmultiple days, create\none DWR per day per job.",
        "The Job field is next.\n\n-- Click Job dropdown --\n\nPick the job you worked\non today.\n\nI'll choose \"Boundary\nSurvey - 5th Avenue,\"\nthe job we built in the\nlast episode.",

        "First, let's look at the\nJob details.\n\n-- Click Job Details --\n\nHere you can see the\ndetails of the job.",
        "Let's move into Labour\nCosts.\n\nWhen you click the add\nbutton\n\n-- Click Add under Labour --\n\nyou will see Cost Items,\nEmployees, Hours, and\nDescription of work.",
        "Click the Cost Item\ndropdown.\n\n-- Click Cost Item dropdown --",
        "This section pulls line\nitems from the job, so\nwhat you're seeing here\nis based on the setup we\ndid earlier, when we\ncreated the job.\n\nDifferent jobs will have\ndifferent line items to\npick from.",
        "Choose the labour line\nitem that matches the\nwork performed.\n\nI'll select \"1 Man\nSurvey Crew.\"",
        "Now select the Employee\nthat did the work.\n\n-- Click Employee dropdown --\n\nA crew lead can add time\nfor the rest of the crew\nas well.\n\nWe'll add additional\nlabour in just a moment.",

        "-- Click Clock Select 4 pm --\n\nAnd an end time of 4pm.",
        "Notice that the hours\nare calculated\nautomatically.",
        "Finally you have the\nDescription of the work.\n\nThe description helps\nwith record keeping and\nDWR approvals so make\nsure you add enough\ndetails.\n\n-- Type \"Set control points along south property line. Heavy rain delayed layout after 1 PM.\" --\n\nA detailed note helps\nthe project manager\nunderstand the day at a\nglance without calling\nyou for more context.",
        "If you need to break the\nshift into multiple\nactivities or need to\nadd another crew member,\nadd another labour line\nitem.\n\nWhen a crew lead enters\ntime for others, make\nsure the hours match\nwhat they worked.",
        "I'll go ahead and add\nanother crew member.\n\n-- Click Add --",
        "Notice all the familiar\nfields.",

        "Denice worked the same\nhours as me so this time\nI'll just input 8 hours,\ninstead of using a start\nand end time.",

        "Select the equipment\nline item In my case,\nI'll select \"Robotic\nTotal Station\" and enter\nthe number of hours.\n\n-- Type \"8\" --",
        "Add any consumables or\nmaterials as separate\nitems.\n\nI'll add four \"Iron\nSurvey Posts\".\n\n-- Type \"4\" --",
        "Notice for Equipment and\nMaterials, the\nDescription is not a\nrequired field.",
        "Below DWR Details is the\nRepresentative\nSignature.\n\nBecause someone can\ncreate DWRs for other\nemployees, the person\ncreating the record\nneeds to sign off on it.\n\nAssuming you've saved\nyour signature as an\nemployee, clicking the\n\"Add My Signature\"\nbutton will\nautomatically add your\nsignature and fill in\nthe Representative\nfield.",
        "The Client's\nRepresentative Signature\nis optional, used when\ntechnicians need to get\na client's signature on\na DWR.",
        "If you're still working\nin the field and plan to\ncome back later to add\ninformation, uncheck the\nSubmitted box.\n\nDWRs that have not been\nsubmitted will be in\nyour My Form Not\nSubmitted tab.\n\nMore on that later in\nthe video.",
        "I'll uncheck the\nSubmitted checkbox to\nshow you.",
        "Now let's save the\nrecord.",

        "-- Click My Forms Not Approved --\n\nThis is the My Forms Not\nApproved tab.\n\nNotice there are no DWRs\nhere.",
        "DWRs located in the My\nForms Not Submitted or\nMy Forms Not Approved\ntabs can be edited.\n\nOnce the DWR has been\napproved, it can no\nlonger be edited by a\ntechnician.\n\nIf you need to edit a\nDWR that has been\napproved, you'll need to\nask a Project Manager or\nAdministrator to uncheck\nthe Submitted box so you\ncan edit it again.",
        "-- Click All My Forms --\n\nThe All My Forms tab\nwill show all your DWRs.\n\nOnce a DWR has been\napproved you will only\nbe able to see it in\nthis tab.\n\nYou can not edit DWRs in\nthis tab.",
        "Let's go ahead and\nsubmit the DWR we just\ncreated.\n\nTo do that click on My\nForms Not Submitted.\n\n-- Click My Forms Not Submitted --\n\nThen click on the DWR.",

        "For now click the Edit\nbutton so we can submit\nthe DWR.\n\n-- Click Edit --",
        "Here you can edit\nwhatever information you\nlike.\n\nWhen everything is\ncomplete and accurate,\ncheck the Submitted box\nand save.\n\nThis will add the DWR to\nthe approval backlog for\nyour project manager.",
        "Notice the Submitted\nDate is automatically\nsaved.",
        "-- Click Save --\n\nOnce saved click the\nBack button\n\n-- Click Back --",
        "You'll notice on the\nExplore list your DWR is\ngone.\n\nThat's because you are\nin the My Form Not\nSubmitted tab.\n\nIf you click on the My\nForm Not Approved tab\n\n-- Click My Forms Not Approved --\n\nYou should see your DWR\nwaiting to be approved\nby a project manager.",
        "That's about everything\nyou need to know to\ncreate Daily Work\nRecords in Job Book.",
        "If you are a project\nmanager you might be\ninterested in how to\napprove all these DWRs.\n\nIf so check out our DWR\nApproval Backlog video.\n\nWe'll step through that\napproval process from\nthe manager's point of\nview.",
        "If you are an\nadministrator you might\nbe interested in how to\nturn all these DWRs into\ninvoices.\n\nIf so check out our DWR\nInvoice Backlog video.\n\nWe'll step through that\ninovice creation from\nthe administrator's\npoint of view.",
        "Before we wrap up, here\nare a few best\npractices:\n\nSubmit DWRs every day.\n\nWaiting until the end of\nthe week increases the\nrisk of missing hours or\nlosing track of\nequipment.\n\nDouble-check the job and\ndate before submitting.\n\nReassigning DWRs after\napproval takes time away\nfrom billing the job.",
        "By following these\nsteps, every DWR becomes\na reliable record that\nsupports approvals,\ndashboards, and invoices\nwithout extra work.",
        "In the next video, we'll\nstay in the technician\nrole and walk through\ncreating expenses.",
        "Thanks for watching, and\nI'll see you in the next\nvideo!"
