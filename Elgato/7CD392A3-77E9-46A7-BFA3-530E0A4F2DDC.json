        "DWRs are the backbone of\nJob Book.\n\nThey replace paper \ntimesheets, \nkeep labour,\nequipment and materials\ntied to the correct job,\nand feed the approval,\ninvoicing, \nand reporting workflows you'll \nsee later in this series.",

        "Notice that the hours\nare calculated automatically.",
        "Finally you have the\nDescription of the work.\n\nThe description helps with\nrecord keeping and\nDWR approvals \nso make sure you \nadd enough details.\n\n-- Type \"Set control points along south property line. Heavy rain delayed layout after 1 PM.\" --\n\nA detailed note helps\nthe project manager\nunderstand the day at a\nglance without calling you \nfor more context.",
        "If you need to break \nthe shift into multiple\nactivities or need to\nadd another crew member,\nadd another labour line item.\n\nWhen a crew lead enters time \nfor others, \nmake sure the hours match\nwhat they worked.",

        "You'll notice \non the Explore list \nyour DWR is now gone.\n\nThat's because you are\nin the \nMy Form Not Submitted tab.\n\nIf you click on the \nMy Form Not Approved tab\n\n-- Click My Forms Not Approved --\n\nYou should see your DWR\nwaiting to be approved by \na project manager.",
        "That's about everything you \nneed to know to create \nDaily Work Records \nin Job Book.",
        "If you are a project manager \nyou might be interested in \nhow to approve all these \nDWRs.\n\nIf so check out our DWR \nApproval Backlog video.\n\nWe'll step through that \napproval process from\nthe manager's \npoint of view.",

        "Before we wrap up, \nhere are a few best practices:\n\nSubmit DWRs every day.\n\nWaiting until the end of\nthe week increases the risk \nof missing hours or\nlosing track of equipment.\n\nDouble-check the job \nand date before submitting.\n\nReassigning DWRs after \napproval takes time away\nfrom billing the job.",
        "By following these steps,\nevery DWR becomes\na reliable record that\nsupports approvals,\ndashboards, \nand invoices\nwithout extra work.",
        "In the next video,\nwe'll stay in the technician \nrole and walk through\ncreating expenses.",
        "Thanks for watching! and I’ll \nsee you in the  next video!\n\nAnd don’t forget to subscribe \nfor more Job Book updates\nand helpful how-to videos!"
