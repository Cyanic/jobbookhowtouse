        "Welcome back to the Job Book How\nto Use Series.",
        "If you’re just joining, make\nsure you’ve watched the earlier\nepisodes because each one builds\non the last.",
        "In the Creating DWRs and\nCreating Expenses videos, we\ncreated timesheets and expenses\nand assigned them to jobs.",
        "All those submissions feed into\nthe Active Job Dashboard. The\nActive Job Dashboard brings job\nstatus, labour, expenses, and\nbilling together in one view.",
        "Staying on top of it helps you\ntrack your budget, keep invoices\nmoving, and maintain predictable\ncash flow.",
        "You can see job status and dive\ndeep into individual job\nperformance metrics.",
        "I am currently logged in as a\nProject Manager. Administrators\nand Job Coordinators see the\nsame layout and follow the same\nsteps.",
        "From the main dashboard, look at\nthe Jobs card in the top row.\nThen click the Active Job\nDashboard button.\n-- Click Active Job Dashboard --\nThe Active Job Dashboard becomes\nthe control center for every\nlive project.",
        "At the top left, you’ll see the\nExport to Excel button. Clicking\nit downloads an Excel file with\nall the job data you’re\ncurrently viewing.",
        "Next to that is the Templating\nsection, where you can create\ntemplates to customize how you\nview the Active Job Dashboard.",
        "We do a deep dive into\ntemplating in our Job Book\nReporting Guide Series",
        "Below that is the grouping bar.\nYou can drag column headers here\nto group jobs by Client Name,\nProject Manager, or any other\nfield.",
        "Again we do a deep dive into\nthis advanced feature in our Job\nBook Reporting Guide Series.",
        "Below that you have the Job\nTable. The Job Table displays\nall active jobs in the system.\nYou can change how many columns\nyou see and apply filters to the\ndata. More about that later in\nthis video.",
        "In the default view, from left\nto right, you’ll see the Job\nNumber, the Client Name, and the\nProject Manager.",
        "the Status column shows exactly\nwhere that job sits in your\nworkflow, whether that is Job\nSetup, In Progress, Ready for\nBilling, or any stage your\ncompany uses.",
        "Next the Billing Type, and Due\nDate.",
        "The next set of columns are the\nkey indicators project managers\nrely on.",
        "The Purchase Order amount shows\nthe client’s approved budget.\nThe DWR amount adds up all\napproved hours to date\nmultiplied by their billing\nrates.",
        "The Expenses to Date column\nshows all reimbursable costs\nsubmitted through the expense\nworkflow.",
        "Next are the Total Invoiced,\nLast Invoice Date, and the\nAction column.",
        "The Action column has four\nbuttons. Each button is specific\nto the job.",
        "The Job Charge-Out Rate Report\nshows all DWR and invoice\nactivity.",
        "The Job Charge-Out Rate Summary\nReport combines all line items\nso you can compare budgeted\namounts, DWRs, and invoices.",
        "The Job History Report lists\nevery line item linked to a job,\nincluding assets and notes.",
        "Each report provides valuable\ninsights that can help you make\ninformed decisions about job\nperformance, costs, and history\nrelated to the job.",
        "For detailed instructions on\nthese reports see our Job Book\nReporting Guide Series.",
        "The final button is the Create\nInvoice button. If the job was\nset to time and material that\nbutton will take you to the DWR\nInvoice Backlog and filters for\nonly the DWRs linked to that\njob.",
        "If the job was set to fixed\nprice that button will create an\nInvoice for that job.",
        "If the job was set to\nnon-chargeable or overhead the\nbutton will not be displayed.",
        "We cover the DWR Inovice Backlog\nand Invoice creation later in\nthis How to Use Job Book Series.",
        "The Job Table is a crucial tool\nfor tracking job performance and\nis essential to ensure accurate\nbudgeting and financial\naccountability.",
        "Some of you eagle-eyed viewers,\nmight notice a blue triangle on\nthe left side of the table. If\nyou click the triangle, it\nexpands to show all the invoices\nlinked to that job.",
        "Looking at the Job Number column\nyou'll see a black arrow. This\nwill sort the invoices in\nascending or descending order.\nIf you click the arrow again\nthat column will be unsorted.",
        "You can sort by any column in\nthe table by clicking on the\ncolumn.\n-- Click Client --",
        "You can add or remove columns in\nthe Job Table. Simply click the\nthree black dots on any of the\ncolumns.\n-- Click 3-dots --",
        "You’ll see a dropdown with\noptions to sort ascending or\ndescending, choose columns, or\napply filters. Hover over\nColumns to see a checklist of\nevery available column. Columns\nthat are currently visible are\nchecked. Unchecked columns are\nhidden.",
        "If the Billing Type column isn’t\nimportant to you as a project\nmanager, just uncheck it and it\nwill disappear from your view.",
        "Speaking of Project Manager that\ncolumn shows all the project\nmanagers for all the active\njobs. You’re probably not\ninterested in jobs you don’t\nmanage, so let’s filter the list\nto show only your own jobs.\nClick the three black dots again\nover the Project Manager column.\n-- Click 3-dots --",
        "And hover over the filter item.\nYou can use “Show items where\nthe value is equal to,” or, what\nI prefer, “Starts with” or\n“Contains.” Then type your name.\n-- Write Lance --\nand click Filter\n-- Click Filter --\nNow you can see only the jobs\nyou are managing in the\ndashboard, making it easier to\nmanage your jobs and\nstreamlining your workflow.",
        "That’s about the basics of the\nActive Job Dashboard.",
        "If you want to learn about\ngrouping columns, creating and\nusing templates, or exploring\nreports like the Job Charge-Out\nRate Report, the Summary Report,\nor the Job History Report, check\nout our Job Book Reporting Guide\nSeries.",
        "Here is how the Active Job\nDashboard ties into the rest of\nJob Book.",
        "Every DWR and expense you saw in\nearlier episodes updates these\nmetrics the moment it’s\nsubmitted. Project managers rely\non these numbers to manage their\njobs effectively.",
        "Administrators use the Active\nJob Dashboard to quickly find\njobs and then either use the DWR\nInvoice Backlog or the invoice\nmodule to keep billing on\nschedule.",
        "Keeping the dashboard accurate\nrequires a few habits. Update\njob statuses as soon as\nmilestones change. Inactive jobs\ncan’t be used by technicians\nwhen creating DWRs, so keeping\nyour job list up to date helps\nprevent mistakes.",
        "Make sure new jobs include\nbudget quantities, even for time\nand materials work, because the\nburn column compares actuals to\nthose targets.",
        "Encourage technicians to submit\nDWRs and expenses every day.\nOtherwise, the Hours to Date and\nExpenses to Date columns will\nfall behind reality.",
        "When a job shows activity but no\napproved billing, check whether\ninvoices are waiting for\ndocuments or sitting in draft.",
        "Best practices keep the\ndashboard useful day after day.\nCheck the dashboard every\nmorning to spot issues before\ncrews leave the office.",
        "Review the Burn column before\nclient calls so you can address\npotential overruns proactively.\nIf a job shows zero entries for\nseveral days, call the field\nlead and confirm that crews are\nsubmitting DWRs on time.",
        "Administrators and project\nmanagers should schedule a\nstanding dashboard review.",
        "Keep this rhythm and the Active\nJob Dashboard becomes your\nsingle source of truth for how\nyour operations are performing.\nYou’ll always know which jobs\nare healthy, which need\nattention, and which approvals\nmust be finalized before\ninvoices go out.",
        "In the next video, we will stay\nin the project manager role and\nwork through the DWR Approval\nBacklog so technician\nsubmissions keep moving without\ndelay.",
        "Thanks for watching, and I’ll\nsee you in the next video!",
