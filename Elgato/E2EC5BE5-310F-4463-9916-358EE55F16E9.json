        "Next the Billing Type, \nand Due Date.",
        "The next set of columns\nare the key indicators\nproject managers rely on.",

        "If the job was set to\nnon-chargeable or\noverhead the button will\nnot be displayed.",
        "We cover the DWR Invoice\nBacklog and Invoice\ncreation later in this\nHow to Use Job Book\nSeries.",
        "The Job Table is a\ncrucial tool for tracking\njob performance and is\nessential to ensure\naccurate budgeting and\nfinancial accountability.",
        "Some of you eagle-eyed\nviewers might notice a\nblue triangle on the left\nside of the table.\nIf you click the\ntriangle, it expands to\nshow all the invoices\nlinked to that job.",
        "Looking at the Job Number\ncolumn you’ll see a black\narrow.\nThis will sort the\ninvoices in ascending or\ndescending order.\nIf you click the arrow\nagain that column will be\nunsorted.",

        "You’ll see a dropdown\nwith options to sort\nascending or descending, \nchoose columns, \nor apply filters.\nHover over Columns to see\na checklist of every\navailable column.\nColumns that are\ncurrently visible are\nchecked.\nUnchecked columns are\nhidden.",
        "If the Billing Type column\nisn’t important to you\nas a project manager, \njust uncheck it and it\nwill disappear from your\nview.",
        "Speaking of Project\nManager, that column\nshows all the project\nmanagers for all the\nactive jobs.\nYou’re probably not\ninterested in jobs you\ndon’t manage, \nso let’s filter the list\nto show only your own\njobs.\nClick the three black\ndots again over the\nProject Manager column.\n\n-- Click 3-dots --",
        "And hover over the\nfilter item.\nYou can use\n“Show items where the value is equal to,”\nor, what I prefer,\n“Starts with” or\n“Contains.”\nThen type your name.\n\n-- Write Lance --\n\nand click Filter\n\n-- Click Filter --\n\nNow you can see only the\njobs you are managing in\nthe dashboard, \nmaking it easier to\nmanage your jobs and\nstreamlining your\nworkflow.",

        "Here is how the Active\nJob Dashboard ties into\nthe rest of Job Book.",
        "Every DWR and expense\nyou saw in earlier\nepisodes updates these\nmetrics the moment it’s\nsubmitted.\nProject managers rely on\nthese numbers to manage\ntheir jobs effectively.",
        "Administrators use the\nActive Job Dashboard to\nquickly find jobs and\nthen either use the DWR\nInvoice Backlog or the\ninvoice module to keep\nbilling on schedule.",
        "Keeping the dashboard\naccurate requires a few\nhabits.\nUpdate job statuses as\nsoon as milestones\nchange.\nInactive jobs can’t be\nused by technicians when\ncreating DWRs, \nso keeping your job list\nup to date helps prevent\nmistakes.",
        "Make sure new jobs\ninclude budget\nquantities, \neven for time and\nmaterials work, \nbecause the burn column\ncompares actuals to\nthose targets.",
        "Encourage technicians to\nsubmit DWRs and\nexpenses every day.\nOtherwise, the Hours to\nDate and Expenses to\nDate columns will fall\nbehind reality.",
        "When a job shows\nactivity but no approved\nbilling, \ncheck whether invoices\nare waiting for\ndocuments or sitting in\ndraft.",
        "Best practices keep the\ndashboard useful day\nafter day.\nCheck the dashboard\nevery morning to spot\nissues before crews\nleave the office.",
        "Review the Burn column\nbefore client calls so\nyou can address\npotential overruns\nproactively.\nIf a job shows zero\nentries for several days, \ncall the field lead and\nconfirm that crews are\nsubmitting DWRs on time.",
        "Administrators and\nproject managers should\nschedule a standing\ndashboard review.",
        "Keep this rhythm and the\nActive Job Dashboard\nbecomes your single\nsource of truth for how\nyour operations are\nperforming.\nYou’ll always know which\njobs are healthy, \nwhich need attention, \nand which approvals must\nbe finalized before\ninvoices go out.",
        "In the next video, \nwe will stay in the\nproject manager role\nand work through the DWR\nApproval Backlog so\ntechnician submissions\nkeep moving without\ndelay.",
        "Thanks for watching, \nand I’ll see you in the\nnext video!",
