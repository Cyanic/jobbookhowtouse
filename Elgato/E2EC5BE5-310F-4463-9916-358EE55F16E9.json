        "Welcome back to the Job Book How to Use Series.",
        "If you’re just joining, make sure you’ve watched the earlier episodes \nbecause each one builds on the last.",
        "In the Creating DWRs and Creating Expenses videos, \nwe created timesheets and expenses and assigned them to jobs.",
        "All those submissions feed into the Active Job Dashboard.\nThe Active Job Dashboard brings job status, labour, expenses, and billing together in one view.",
        "Staying on top of it helps you track your budget, keep invoices moving, \nand maintain predictable cash flow.",
        "You can see job status and dive deep into individual job performance metrics.",
        "I am currently logged in as a Project Manager.\nAdministrators and Job Coordinators see the same layout and follow the same steps.",
        "From the main dashboard, look at the Jobs card in the top row.\nThen click the Active Job Dashboard button.\n-- Click Active Job Dashboard --\nThe Active Job Dashboard becomes the control center for every live project.",
        "At the top left, you’ll see the Export to Excel button. \nClicking it downloads an Excel file with all the job data you’re currently viewing.",
        "Next to that is the Templating section, where you can create templates \nto customize how you view the Active Job Dashboard.",
        "We do a deep dive into templating in our Job Book Reporting Guide Series",
        "Below that is the grouping bar. \nYou can drag column headers here to group jobs by Client Name, Project Manager, or any other field.",
        "Again we do a deep dive into this advanced feature in our \nJob Book Reporting Guide Series.",
        "Below that you have the Job Table.\nThe Job Table displays all active jobs in the system.\nYou can change how many columns you see \nand apply filters to the data. More about that later in this video.",
        "In the default view, from left to right, you’ll see \nthe Job Number, the Client Name, and the Project Manager.",
        "the Status column shows exactly where that job sits in your workflow, \nwhether that is Job Setup, In Progress, Ready for Billing, or any stage your company uses.",
        "Next the Billing Type, and Due Date.",
        "The next set of columns are the key indicators project managers rely on.",
        "The Purchase Order amount shows the client’s approved budget. \nThe DWR amount adds up all approved hours to date multiplied by their billing rates.",
        "The Expenses to Date column shows all reimbursable costs submitted through the expense workflow.",
        "Next are the Total Invoiced, Last Invoice Date, and the Action column.",
        "The Action column has four buttons. Each button is specific to the job.",
        "The Job Charge-Out Rate Report shows all DWR and invoice activity.",
        "The Job Charge-Out Rate Summary Report combines all line items \nso you can compare budgeted amounts, DWRs, and invoices.",
        "The Job History Report lists every line item linked to a job, including assets and notes.",
        "Each report provides valuable insights that can help you make informed decisions \nabout job performance, costs, and history related to the job.",
        "For detailed instructions on these reports see our Job Book Reporting Guide Series.",
        "The final button is the Create Invoice button.\nIf the job was set to time and material that button will take you to the DWR Invoice Backlog \nand filters for only the DWRs linked to that job.",
        "If the job was set to fixed price that button will create an Invoice for that job.",
        "If the job was set to non-chargeable or overhead the button will not be displayed.",
        "We cover the DWR Inovice Backlog and Invoice creation later in this How to Use Job Book Series.",
        "The Job Table is a crucial tool for tracking job performance \nand is essential to ensure accurate budgeting and financial accountability.",
        "Some of you eagle-eyed viewers, might notice a blue triangle on the left side of the table.\nIf you click the triangle, it expands to show all the invoices linked to that job.",
        "Looking at the Job Number column you'll see a black arrow. \nThis will sort the invoices in ascending or descending order.\nIf you click the arrow again that column will be unsorted.",
        "You can sort by any column in the table by clicking on the column.\n-- Click Client --",
        "You can add or remove columns in the Job Table. \nSimply click the three black dots on any of the columns.\n-- Click 3-dots --",
        "You’ll see a dropdown with options to sort ascending or descending, choose columns, or apply filters. \nHover over Columns to see a checklist of every available column.\nColumns that are currently visible are checked. Unchecked columns are hidden.",
        "If the Billing Type column isn’t important to you as a project manager, \njust uncheck it and it will disappear from your view.",
        "Speaking of Project Manager that column shows all the project managers for all the active jobs.\nYou’re probably not interested in jobs you don’t manage, so let’s filter the list to show only your own jobs.\nClick the three black dots again over the Project Manager column. \n-- Click 3-dots --",
        "And hover over the filter item.\nYou can use “Show items where the value is equal to,” or, what I prefer, “Starts with” or “Contains.”\nThen type your name.\n-- Write Lance --\nand click Filter\n-- Click Filter --\nNow you can see only the jobs you are managing in the dashboard, \nmaking it easier to manage your jobs and streamlining your workflow.",
        "That’s about the basics of the Active Job Dashboard.",
        "If you want to learn about grouping columns, creating and using templates, \nor exploring reports like the Job Charge-Out Rate Report, \nthe Summary Report, or the Job History Report, \ncheck out our Job Book Reporting Guide Series.",
        "Here is how the Active Job Dashboard ties into the rest of Job Book.",
        "Every DWR and expense you saw in earlier episodes updates these metrics the moment it’s submitted. \nProject managers rely on these numbers to manage their jobs effectively.",
        "Administrators use the Active Job Dashboard to quickly find jobs and then either \nuse the DWR Invoice Backlog or the invoice module to keep billing on schedule.",
        "Keeping the dashboard accurate requires a few habits. \nUpdate job statuses as soon as milestones change.\nInactive jobs can’t be used by technicians when creating DWRs, \nso keeping your job list up to date helps prevent mistakes.",
        "Make sure new jobs include budget quantities, even for time and materials work, \nbecause the burn column compares actuals to those targets.",
        "Encourage technicians to submit DWRs and expenses every day. \nOtherwise, the Hours to Date and Expenses to Date columns will fall behind reality.",
        "When a job shows activity but no approved billing, check whether invoices are \nwaiting for documents or sitting in draft.",
        "Best practices keep the dashboard useful day after day. \nCheck the dashboard every morning to spot issues before crews leave the office.",
        "Review the Burn column before client calls so you can address potential overruns proactively. \nIf a job shows zero entries for several days, call the field lead and confirm that \ncrews are submitting DWRs on time.",
        "Administrators and project managers should schedule a standing dashboard review.",
        "Keep this rhythm and the Active Job Dashboard becomes your single source of truth \nfor how your operations are performing. You’ll always know which jobs are healthy, \nwhich need attention, and which approvals must be finalized before invoices go out.",
        "In the next video, we will stay in the project manager role \nand work through the DWR Approval Backlog \nso technician submissions keep moving without delay.",
        "Thanks for watching, and I’ll see you in the next video!",
