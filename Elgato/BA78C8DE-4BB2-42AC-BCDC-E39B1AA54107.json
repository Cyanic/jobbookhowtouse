        "Welcome back to the Job Book How\nto Use Series. If this is your\nfirst time watching, remember\nthat each episode builds on the\nlast.",
        "In the last video we explored\nthe DWR Approval Backlog. We\nbulk approved daily work records\nbefore they flowed into payroll\nand invoicing.",
        "In this episode, we’re going to\nclear the Expense Approval\nBacklog. This is where submitted\nexpenses wait for a Project\nManager or Administrator to\nreview. Think of it as the\ngatekeeper that protects cash\nflow, reimbursement accuracy,\nand client billing integrity.",
        "Before we jump into Job Book,\nlet's talk about why this\nbacklog matters. Expenses in Job\nBook are costs paid by staff on\nbehalf of a job that need\nreimbursement. If we approve\nthem blindly we risk billing the\nwrong client or paying staff for\nthe wrong amount. A steady\napproval rhythm keeps\nreimbursements timely and your\ngeneral ledger clean. It also\nkeeps our job budgets\ntrustworthy when leadership\nchecks the numbers.",
        "I am logged in as an\nAdministrator so I can see every\nexpense awaiting review. You can\nfollow the same process as a\nProject Manager if that is the\nrole assigned to you.",
        "Now let’s walk through the\nscreen together and see how the\napproval process works. From the\nmain dashboard, look at the\nWorkflow card in the middle of\nthe second row, In the Workflow\nlist choose Expense Approval\nBacklog.\n-- Click Expense Approval Backlog --\nThe Expense Approval Backlog is\nthe expense batch approval\ncenter for Job Book.",
        "At the top left you will see the\nApprove Selected Expenses\nbutton. It will stay inactive\nuntil we have at least one\nexpense checked. At the top\nright, you’ll see the Undo Last\nApproval Batch button.",
        "Below that is the grouping bar.\nYou can drag column headers here\nto group jobs by Job Number,\nEmployee Name, or other fields.",
        "Below that is the Expense Table.\nThe Expense table lists every\nsubmitted expense that still\nneeds approval.",
        "The first column is a checkbox.\nClicking the checkbox in the\nheader selects all expenses for\nbulk approval. Unchecking it\nclears all selections.",
        "Next is the Date column. The\nDate column contains hyperlinks\nto the individual Expenses.",
        "Then you have the Submitted\nDate, Job Number, Expense Item,\nEmployee Name, Amount, and\nDescription columns.",
        "By default, Expenses are sorted\nby Date and Employee Name in\nascending order. That means the\noldest Expenses appear first,\nand within each day, they’re\nsorted by Employee Name.",
        "You can sort by multiple columns\nat once. To focus on one column,\nremove sorting from the others\nby clicking the sorted column\nuntil the arrow disappears.",
        "Just like we did in the DWR\nApproval Backlog video in this\nseries.",
        "Just like the DWR Approval\nBacklog, you can filter data\nusing the filter icon or by\ntyping in the quick filter field\nin certain columns.",
        "Sometimes an Expense might need\na small adjustment. If it’s just\na typo or a minor fix, you can\ncorrect it on the spot.",
        "If you need to edit or see\nattachments on an Expense, click\nthe hyperlink.\n-- Click Expense hyperlink --\nA new browser tab will open\n-- Click Expense Tab --\nwhere you can review, edit, or\nmanually approve the expense.",
        "You can also check off the\nProcessed checkbox. The\nProcessed checkbox can mean\ndifferent things depending on\nthe situation. For\nreimbursements, it means the\nstaff member has already been\npaid. For billable expenses, it\nmeans the expense was included\non an invoice.",
        "If you want to learn more about\nthe relationship between\nProcessed and Unprocessed\nExpenses in Invoices check out\nthe Creating Invoices video\nlater in this series.",
        "If the submission needs more\nwork, tell the staff member who\nsubmitted the Expense to edit it\ninstead. Technicians can edit\ntheir own Expenses until they’ve\nbeen approved. Be clear about\nwhat needs to change and why.",
        "Just like the DWR Approval\nBacklog approving multiple\nExpenses one by one can get\ncumbersome.\n-- Click Expense Approval Backlog Tab --",
        "If you recall from the Creating\nExpenses video in this series\nevery expense represents one\nitem or receipt.",
        "From the Expense table you\nshould have all the information\nneeded to approve an expense\nwithout opening each Expense\nindividually.",
        "After you’ve reviewed the\nExpenses, check the boxes for\nthe ones you want to approve.\nThe Approve Selected Expenses\nbutton will become active.",
        "To approve in bulk, click the\nApprove Selected Expenses\nbutton.\n-- Click Approve Selected Expenses --",
        "You’ll see a confirmation pop-up\nshowing the number of Expenses\nyou’re about to approve. Click\nOK.\n-- Click OK --",
        "The selected Expenses have now\nbeen approved. You’ll notice\nthey disappear from the backlog\nimmediately. Approving Expenses\nlocks the records, meaning\nthey’re no longer editable by\ntechnicians.",
        "Just like the DWR Approval\nBacklog you can undo a batch\napproval by clicking on the Undo\nLast Approval Batch button.",
        "The process to manually\nunapprove an Expense is the same\nas for unapproving DWRs. You\nneed to locate the approved\nExpense, Edit the expense, and\nucheck the Approved checkbox.",
        "That’s about all there is for\nthe Expense Approval Backlog.",
        "Let's talk about integration.\nExpenses flow directly into the\nActive Job Dashboard, allowing\nProject Managers to compare\ncommitted costs against\nestimates.",
        "When invoicing a Job all\nexpenses related to the job are\nlisted. Administrators can then\ninclude those expenses if needed\nand set the expenses to\nProcessed.",
        "Here are a few best practices\nthat seasoned administrators\nfollow. First, schedule a daily\napproval window. Clearing the\nbacklog at the same time each\nday keeps reimbursements\npredictable for staff. Second,\nscan for duplicates before you\napprove. If two employees\nsubmitted the same hotel\nreceipt, reject the duplicate\nimmediately. These small habits\nkeep approvals fast without\nsacrificing accuracy.",
        "Before we wrap up, let's recap\nwhat we covered. We opened the\nExpense Approval Backlog from\nthe Workflow card. We reviewed\nan expense record, checked\nattachments, and confirmed job\ncoding. We approved clean\nexpenses. We used bulk approvals\nto speed up high-volume days.\nMost importantly, we saw how\nthis backlog feeds invoicing,\nreporting, and cash flow.",
        "In the next video we will move\ndeeper into billing and explore\nthe DWR Invoice Backlog. That’s\nwhere DWRs for Time and Material\njobs land, making it easy to\nbuild customer invoices.",
        "Thanks for watching, and I’ll\nsee you in the next video!",
