        "\n\n\n\n\nThis is a video series on setting up \nJob Book \nIf you're joining us mid-series, \nI recommend starting from the beginning, \nsince each video builds on the last.\n\nIn the last few sections I showed you how to setup all \nyour line items \nin Job Book.\n\nIn this section we’ll be looking at using those line items to \ncreate rate sheets \nthat we can apply \nto customers \nand jobs in THE \nJob Book system.",
        "Let’s talk generally about what Rate Sheets are and how they fit into the job book system.\n\nYou're probably already familiar with rate sheets, \nand most likely already use them in your company, \nbut if not, \nI’ll explain.\n \nA rate sheet \nis a list that sets out the different prices \nthat apply to a \nrange of services.",
        "Do you remember \nall the prices we set \nfor the line items \nwe made?\n\nA Rate Sheet \nis a collection of those line items \nand their respective prices. \n\nThe prices you set for the individual line items can be over written in the Rate Sheet.\n\nThis allows you to \nadapt pricing for different clients \nor contract types \nwithout recreating items.",
        "For example,\nif you do a job for a specific customer, \nthat customer \nmight have negotiated \na set price for the \nline items \nyou will charge them.\n \nIn that example \nyou can create a \nrate sheet \nspecifically for that customer \nand apply it to all the jobs that you do for that customer. \n\nAny work done for those jobs \nwill be billed out \nat THAT special \nrate-sheet price.",
        "It might become clearer \nafter you watch our \nClient Creation and \nJob Creation videos in the \nJob Book \nHow to Use Guide. \n\nYou can find links to those videos in the description below.\n\nFor now, \nlet’s jump into creating \nRate Sheets in the system.\n--END--",
        "\n\n\n\n\nOne option for creating rate sheets,\nis from the dashboard \n\nFind the Rate Sheets card.\n\n\nThen Click on the Create New button.\n\n\nAlternatively, you can Click the Navigate button in the top-left corner.\n\n\nThen Click on Rate Sheets.\n\n\nAnd click the Create button.\n\n\nEither option does the same thing so use what is comfortable to you. ",
        "The first field is the “Name” field. \nLet’s fill in the name of your rate sheet, \nlet's call it:\n`Standard Rates`\n",
        "The next field is “Notes”. \nYou can put whatever notes you like here. \nI’ll simply say something like: \n`Standard RATE SHEET`\n",
        "The next field is “Billable Line Items”. \n\nYou’ll notice there are three tabs inside it.\n \nLabour Costs, \n\nEquipment & Materials, \n\nand Fixed Price. \n\nCorresponding to the \nline items we created \nearlier in the series.\n  \nWhat we are going to \ndo now is add \nwhatever line items \nand rates \nwe want \nto this Standard \nRate-Sheet.\n\n\nLet's start with adding some \nLabout Costs Items",
        "Select the Labour Costs tab\n\nThen click the ‘Add’ button to add a line item.\n\nYou should see the familiar fields from Labour Cost Items. \n\nWe are going to add \nan existing cost item \nto the rate sheet.",
        "To do that, \n\nselect the dropdown\n\n\nand click on any existing line item.\n\nNote that your cost items will most likely be different then what I have\n\nWe'll pick “Survey Party Chief”\n \nand add it to the rate sheet.\n\nYou’ll notice \n\nthe Name, \n\nthe Unit, \n\nthe Unit Cost, \n\nthe Hourly Cost,\n\nand Tax Exempt \nwere all auto populated from what we created previously in the \nLabour Cost items video.\n\nYou’ll notice the Unit Cost is $125 — the default amount we set earlier.\n\nWhen you create a Rate Sheets you can override the default price.",
        "\nThis override only affects this specific Rate Sheet — the original line item remains unchanged.\n\nLet’s change the price from $125 to $130. \n\n\n\nNow when you use this rate sheet on a job the price for “Survey Party Chief” will default to $130 based off of the Rate Sheet.",
        "I’ll go ahead and add more line items \nto the Labour Costs, \n\nThen I'll go to the Equipment and Materials tab, \nand the Fixed Price tab \n\nand add line items to them.\n\nI'll fast forward this part, \npause as needed, \nthen create your own \nline items \nto your own\nrate sheet.\n--END--",
        "\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see I've added some line items to \n\nthe Labour Costs tab,\n\n\nthe Equipment and Materials tab\n\n\n\nand to the Fixed Price tab\n\n\n\nOnce you have completed your rate sheet \nclick the save button,\nthat will create the rate sheet in \nthe Job Book system. \n\nAnd don’t worry — you can always come back and edit your Rate Sheet later.\n“HIT SAVE”",
        "After you save a rate sheet, you will see the Display screen.\n\nFrom here you can \nEdit the Rate Sheet\n\nExport the Rate Sheet to PDF\n\nClone or copy the rate sheet\n\nDelete the Rate sheet \n\nOr click on the Back button\n\nThat will take you back to the item list\n\nClick the Back button\n\nAs you can see our new Standard Rates, rate sheet is now displayed on the item list.",
        "I’ll go ahead and create a few more Rate Sheets \nas examples \nso we have something to work with.\n\nI'll do this by cloning the original Standard Rates, rate sheet\nand modifying it as needed. \n\nFeel free to pause the video and create your own custom rate sheets.\n\n(Create: Subdivision  Survey, Residential Survey, Boundary Survey, Construction Survey,\nBechtel Contract #783CS1872, City of Springfield) \n--END--",
        "\n\n\n\n\n\nOk as you can see, I’ve created a bunch of Rate Sheets.\n\nSo how are rate sheets \nused in Job Book?",
        "Rate Sheets can be applied to customers, \nso that each new job \nfor that customer \nuses the correct pricing by default.\n\nYou can also apply a rate sheet \nto a specific job. \n\nA lot of our customers create rate sheets \nfor every job they bid\nand then apply those rates \nto the specific job. \n\nIf you are interested in \nclient creation \nor job creation, \nsee our Job Book \nHow to \nUse Guide series \nfor more information. \n\nOr click on the link below in the description to learn more.",
        "That is about all there is to rate sheets.\n\nIn the next video, \nI’ll show you how to set up Expense Items \nin Job Book. \n\nAfter that, \nwe’ll cover creating Users.\n\nThanks for watching\n\nand I'll see you in the next video!"
