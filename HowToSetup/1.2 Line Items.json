        "\nThis is a video series on setting up Job Book, \n\nif you are coming to this series from the middle, \nI would recommend you start at the beginning of the \nseries as each video will build on the next.\n\nIn the last section \nI showed you how \nto setup your office in \nJob Book.\nIn this section \nwe’ll be talking \nabout what line items are in \ngneral and how \nJob Book \nhandles them. ",
        "\nThere isn’t much to set up in this section, but this will be the basis for the following sections on, \nLabour Cost Line Items, \nEquipment & Materials, \nand Fixed Price Line Items.\n\nThis section should give you a good foundation of understanding on how to use and setup line items in the Job Book system.",
        "\nSo, what are Line Items? \nLine items are anything your staff keep track of, \nthink of... \nyour time sheets..., \nor anything your company uses to invoice your customers. \n\nIn Job Book we separate line items into logical and practical categories, or collections.",
        "\nOne type of collection we call, Labour Cost Line Items. \nLabour Cost line items are line items that deal with labour; \nspecifically, labour that your company pays for in payroll \nor charges your customer in invoices. \nThese line items are typically in units of hours \nbut can be in units of days or other units. ",
        "\nOne of the many things that is unique to Job Book \nis NOT only do we keep track of labour hours \nbut we also keep track of equipment & materials. \nAnd that’s where the \nEquipment & Materials \nline items come into play.",
        "\nEquipment & materials \nline items are \nline items that your staff input into the system \nto keep track of not only the \nequipment & materials \nbut also any \nexpenses that a job incurred.\n\nFor example, \nnot only should you keep track of the \nequipment used \nand for how long \nbut also such things as \ntravel expenses\nof your staff, \nhotels, \nreally any expense associated with a job.\n\nAnything on a job that \ncosts money to the project \nand or needs to be charged to a customer \ncan be recorded \nand should be recorded \nhere by staff. ",
        "\nThe final collection we have is called \nFixed Price Line Items.\n\nFundamentally fixed price line items are \nline items that get added to an invoice by an administrator.\n\nThey do not have labour hours \ndirectly attributed to them. \nTypically, your \nfixed price or \nlump sum jobs \nwill have one or more \nfixed price line items on the invoice. \n\nFor example, \nyou might have A fixed price line item called \nTopographic Survey \nand invoice that. \nBut your staff would still book time towards \nlabour line items associated \nwith the job they were doing \nsuch as drafting or surveying. \n\nSome examples of fixed price line items are:\n- Boundary Surveys, \n- Legal & Compliance Fees\n- Third Party Charges. \nAnd so forth\n\nIt might become clearer after you watch our \ninvoicing video in the \nJob Book How to Use Guide \nyou can find a link to it in the description bellow this video.  ",
        "\nSo how are line items \nused in the Job Book System? \n\nIt’s quite simple. \nAn administrator will create a job. \nAnd then add \nwhatever line items \nare necisary to complete the job. \n\n\nIf you are interested in how \nJobs are created, \nsee our \nJob Book \nHow to Use Guide series \nfor more information that covers \nJob creation.\nOr click on the link below \nin the description to learn more. ",
        "\nWhen technicians \nout in the field \nor in the office \ndo their time sheets \nthey will use those selected \nLabour Cost Line Items \nto keep track of \ntheir time \nand will use those selected \nEquipment and Materials \nLine Items \nto keep track of \ntheir equipment and materials \nused on the job. \n\nIn Job Book \nbecause we also track \nequipment and materials. \nWe don’t call our timesheets, \ntimesheets, \nwe call them \nDaily Work Records \nor DWRs\n\nIf you are interested in how \nDaily Work Records work, \ncheck out the link in the description below \nthat has our \nJob Book \nHow to \nUse Guide series. \nIt covers \nDWRs and other things. ",
        "\nWhen creating invoices \nadministrators can select from \nline items in the system \nand add them to the invoice \nand then bill the job to the customer.\n \nThis is where \nFixed Price Line Items are used. \nThey are typically used \nwhen you are doing \nlump sum jobs, \nbut can be used when doing \ntime & material type jobs \nwhere you would have a mix of: \nLabour Cost \nLine Items, \nEquipment & Materials, \nand Fixed Price \nLine Items.\n \nIf you are interested in \nhow Invoices are created, \nsee our \nJob Book \nHow to Use Guide series \nthat covers Invoice creation. \nOr click on the \nlink below in the \ndescription to learn more.",
        "\nTypically,    \nJob Book IS used to generate invoices \nbut best practice is to \nmigrate those invoices to your \naccounting system like: \nXero, \nSage, \nor Quickbooks.\n \nWhen migrating invoice from Job Book to your accounting system \nthe line items you created in Job Book \nneed to correspond to the line items \nyou have in your accounting system. \n\nJob Book \nhas an easy-to-use \nexport tool \nthat will allow batch invoices to import into your accounting system. \n\nIf you are interested in learning more about how that is done, \nsee our Job Book How to Use Guide series \nfor information that covers \nimporting invoices to the various \naccounting systems. \nOr click on the link below \nin the description to learn more. ",
        "\nEquipment & Materials \nalong with \nLabour Cost items, \nand Fixed Price items \nare all assigned to jobs you create. \n\nEvery day as \nstaff record \nlabour, \nequipment & materials \nyou can get a real time view of \nburn on your projects \nbased on rates set for the job.\n\nEven if you don’t bill your \nequipment & materials \nto your customers \nyou are paying for them \nas a company \nand you should be keeping track of their use. \n\nIn Job Book \nthere is a report called the\nLine Item Report. \nIt’s a real-time report of all the line items \nyour company uses \nincluding the amount \nyou use them. \n\nIf you are interested in the \nLine Item Report, \nsee our \nJob Book Reporting Guide series \nfor more information \non the reports in \nJob Book \nand how to use them. \nOr click on the link below \nin the description \nto learn more. ",
        "\nThat about covers \nline items in Job Book. \n\nIn the next video \nI’m going to show you \nspecificly how to set up \nLabour Line Items in \nJob Book.\n\nAnd in upcoming videos \nI’m going to show you \nhow to set up \nthe rest of the line item types. \n\nHope you enjoy."
