        "\n\n\n\n\nWelcome to our Job Book setup series. \nIf you’re joining mid-way, \nI recommend starting from the beginning\nsince each video builds on the last.\n\nIn the last section I showed you how to setup your\nExpense items in \nJob Book.\n\nIn this section \nwe’ll be looking at creating Users \nand assigning them Roles in the \nJob Book system ",
        "Let’s talk about how\nUsers and Roles \nwork in the Job Book \nsystem.\n\nJob Book uses a standard email and password login, \njust like most platforms you’ve used.\n\nIf you forget your \npassword, \nyou can always \nreset it \nand a reset email \nwill be sent to your email address on file. ",
        "Every user in Job Book also has \npermissions \nassociated with the \naccount. \n\nJob Book has four permission levels: \nTechnicians, Project Managers, Job Coordinator, and Administrators.\n\nTechnicians handle fieldwork and drafting.\n\nProject Managers approve timesheets, invoices, and view reports.\n\nJob Coordinators create jobs and set rates.\n\nAdministrators can do all that, plus manage users and employees.\n\nLet’s see what it \ntakes to \ncreate a user, \nand set roles \nin Job Book.\n\n--END--",
        "\n\n\n\nFrom the dashboard,\n\nclick the Settings icon in the top-right, \n\nthen select \n‘Users.’\n\nThen click the \nCreate button.",
        "The first field is the \n“Name” field. \n\nLet’s fill in the name of your user.\n\nLet's call him: `Charlie C`\n\nThe next field is \n\n“E-mail Address”. \n\nI'll paste his email: charlie@getjobbook.com\n\nThe next field is “Roles”.\n\nSince Charlie is a party chief,\n \nwe’ll assign him the \n\nTechnician role.",
        "Once that is done \nyou can click the \nsave button, \n\nthat will both create \nthe user in the \nJob Book system, \n\nand email the user \na password creation email. \n\nMake sure the email \nyou use exists,\n\nor you'll never see \nthe password \ncreation email.\n\nIf everything looks correct:\n`Click Save`",
        "As you can see our \nnew user is now \ndisplayed on the user list.\n\nYou can edit a user’s \nname or role anytime. \n\nIf you change \nthe email, note \nthat the system won’t \nautomatically resend \nthe password setup \nemail.\n\nYou’ll need to \ntrigger a password \nreset manually \nfrom the login page.",
        "I’ll now create a few more Users in the system so we have something to work with.\n\nFeel free to pause the video and create your own Users. \n\nRemember once you \ncreate a user,\nThat person will \nrecieve an email,\n\nso make sure the email used \nexists.\n\n--END--",
        "***\n(Create: \n(PLS / owner) \nLance Landly, \n\n(Admin) \nOlivia Admina\n\n(Book Keeper) \nPaige Turner, \n\n(AR) \nIsla Voicer, \n\n(PM) \nPerry Project, \nSierra Survey, \n\n(Technician)\nCharlie Chief, \nDenice Rodman) \n***",
        "\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, \nwe now have multiple \nUsers set up.\n\nUsers log in \nto access \nJob Book. \n\nWhat they can see and do, \ndepends on their role: \n\nTechnicians have limited access,\nthey can NOT see any financial data.\n\nProject Managers can view all reports, \nbut can NOT create jobs or change rates.\n\nJob Coordinators can do all that, \nplus create jobs and set rates.\n\nAdministrators have full access \nand are the only ones who can \nmanage users and employees.",
        "If you are interested \nin more detail, \nabout how the \ndiffernt roles interact \nwith the system,\nsee our Job Book \nHow to Use Guide \nseries for more \ninformation. \n\nOr read our help \ndocuments.\n\nLinks to both can be found in the description below this video.",
        "That is about all there is to User creation.\n\nIn the next video, \nI’ll show you how to\ncreate Employees\nin Job Book. \n\nAfter that,\nwe’ll wrap up and \npoint you to additional \nhelp resources.\n\nThanks for watching!\nand I'll see you in the next video!"
