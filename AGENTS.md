# Instructions for Codex

- Do not commit changes until they have been reviewed and approved.
- Ignore the files in `Ignore/`.
- When generating filenames only use ASCII characters
- Do not use em-dash
- This is a script and will therefore be spoken out loud. Ignore when charters like `/` are writend out as `slash`.
